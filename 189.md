# M-05 Vaults push wrong value of `totalUnderlying`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
[pushTotalUnderlyingToController()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L249-L283) push totalUnderlying, totalSupply and totalWithdrawalRequests to xChainController. To do that it starts by setting the total balance in VaultCurrency in all underlying protocols `setTotalUnderlying()`
```solidity
  function setTotalUnderlying() public {
    uint totalUnderlying;
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;
      totalUnderlying += balanceUnderlying(i);
    }
    savedTotalUnderlying = totalUnderlying;
  }
```
this accumulates all the underlying e.g.USDC value on the Defi protocols and set it into `savedTotalUnderlying` But if the protocol has a `claim()` e.g.[Coumpound](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/CompoundProvider.sol#L133-L139). means it still has some funds in it. these funds should be included in `savedTotalUnderlying`

## Impact
Vaults push the wrong value of `totalUnderlying`

## Recommendation
Invoke `claim()` first
