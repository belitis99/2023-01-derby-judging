# Game users may lose this round of rewards if they call rebalanceBasket before the end of step 8

## Summary
By calling `rebalanceBasket`, game users can **not only** allocate funds to the protocols , **but also** get rewards after the system rebalances. The restriction for calling the rebalanceBasket function is `require (!IsXChainRebalancing[vaultNumber][chainIds[k]], "Game: vault is xChainRebalancing")`. After the system rebalancing step 1 is triggered: `isXChainRebalancing[vaultNumber][chainIds[k]]=true`. After the system rebalancing step 6 is triggered: `isXChainRebalancing[vaultNumber][chainIds[k]]=false`. The system distributes rewards at the end of step 8. Therefore, during the period from step 6 to step 8, the user can call the rebalanceBasket function, which will not get rewards this time.
## Vulnerability Detail
The reason for this issue is that **users can call `rebalanceBasket` before the end of rebalancing**. Let's assume that step 6 is triggered now, and some users call `rebalanceBasket`. [[The code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L318-L333)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L318-L333) is as follows:

```js
function rebalanceBasket(
    uint256 _basketId,
    int256[][] memory _deltaAllocations
  ) external onlyBasketOwner(_basketId) nonReentrant {
    uint256 vaultNumber = baskets[_basketId].vaultNumber;
    for (uint k = 0; k < chainIds.length; k++) {
      require(!isXChainRebalancing[vaultNumber][chainIds[k]], "Game: vault is xChainRebalancing");
    }

    addToTotalRewards(_basketId);	//here, This function allocates rewards.
    int256 totalDelta = settleDeltaAllocations(_basketId, vaultNumber, _deltaAllocations); //allocate funds to each protocol on each chain of a vault

    lockOrUnlockTokens(_basketId, totalDelta);
    setBasketTotalAllocatedTokens(_basketId, totalDelta);
    setBasketRebalancingPeriod(_basketId, vaultNumber); //update baskets[_basketId].lastRebalancingPeriod
  }
```

Let's continue to look at the code of [[addTotalRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L368-L401)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L368-L401):

```js
function addToTotalRewards(uint256 _basketId) internal onlyBasketOwner(_basketId) {
    if (baskets[_basketId].nrOfAllocatedTokens == 0) return;

    uint256 vaultNum = baskets[_basketId].vaultNumber;
    uint256 currentRebalancingPeriod = vaults[vaultNum].rebalancingPeriod;
    uint256 lastRebalancingPeriod = baskets[_basketId].lastRebalancingPeriod;

    if (currentRebalancingPeriod <= lastRebalancingPeriod) return; //now currentRebalancingPeriod > lastRebalancingPeriod

    for (uint k = 0; k < chainIds.length; k++) {
      uint32 chain = chainIds[k];
      uint256 latestProtocol = latestProtocolId[chain];
      for (uint i = 0; i < latestProtocol; i++) {
        int256 allocation = basketAllocationInProtocol(_basketId, chain, i) / 1E18;
        if (allocation == 0) continue;
    	//lastRebalanceReward may be 0
        int256 lastRebalanceReward = getRewardsPerLockedToken(
          vaultNum,
          chain,
          lastRebalancingPeriod,
          i
        );
        //currentReward is 0 because the reward has not yet been distributed
        int256 currentReward = getRewardsPerLockedToken(
          vaultNum,
          chain,
          currentRebalancingPeriod,
          i
        );
        baskets[_basketId].totalUnRedeemedRewards +=
          (currentReward - lastRebalanceReward) *	//if lastRebalanceReward = 0, 0 - 0 = 0; if lastRebalanceReward > 0, revert due to underflow
          allocation;
      }
    }
  }
```

**`currentReward` is 0 because the reward has not yet been distributed**. Normally, `lastRebalanceReward` is greater than 0, so `addTotalRewards` is revert due to the subtraction overflow. Is it impossible for `lastRebalanceReward` to be 0? No, it will be 0 in two cases:

1.  When a new vault is deployed, users allocate funds for it and are rewarded for the next rebalancing. Obviously, `lastRebalanceReward` is 0 at that time.
2.  During the n-2 rebalancing, both `currentReward` and `lastRebalanceReward` are greater than 0. But this time, vault is not allocated any funds in A protocol of B chain.
    During the n-1 rebalancing, `currentReward` is 0, `lastRebalanceReward` is greater than 0. But this time, vault is allocated some funds in A protocol of B chain.
    During the n rebalancing, `currentReward` is greater than 0, `lastRebalanceReward` is 0.

At the end of the `rebalanceBasket` function, `setBasketRebalancingPeriod` will be called, and it will update the status: `baskets[_basketId].lastRebalancingPeriod=vaults[_vaultNumber].rebalancingPeriod+1`. This will cause users to call `rebalanceBasket` again after the end of step 8, and they will not receive rewards. `addTotalRewards` returns directly.
## Impact
This issue will cause users not to be rewarded for a certain rebalancing, and the probability of occurrence is not very high.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a Boolean variable, set it to true in step 1, and set it to false at the end of step 8. The user can call `rebalanceBasket` only when this variable is false.
