# Unsafe erc20 method and unsafe transfer/transferFrom

Unsafe erc20 method and unsafe transfer/transferFrom

## Summary
Using IERC20 methods can be reverted on some tokens. also, this contract used a transfer parameter instead of safeTransfer.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens don't work correctly with IERC20 interface and using this method can revert this function for some tokens. also in some lines of XProvider contract transfer parameter used, its means when transfer fail function doesn't revert.

## Impact
Functions have used transferFrom in XProvider contract will revert for some token because used IERC20 unsafe method.
also, some lines of this contract have used transfer instead of safeTransfer so this doesn't revert if transfer failed.
