# Integer Division Vulnerability Causing Rounding Errors in Token Withdrawals.

## Summary
In the `depositInProtocol()` and `withdrawFromProtocol()` functions uses several arithmetic operations that could potentially cause an integer overflow or underflow. Specifically, in the `depositInProtocol()` function, the `_amount` variable is multiplied by "uScale", and the result is divided by `controller.underlyingUScale(protocol.underlying)` without any check for overflow.
Similarly, in the `withdrawFromProtocol()` function, the `_amount` variable is multiplied by `protocol.uScale` and divided by "uScale", which could potentially cause an integer overflow or underflow. 

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
      _amount = Swap.swapStableCoins(
        Swap.SwapInOut(_amount, address(vaultCurrency), protocol.underlying),
        uScale,
        controller.underlyingUScale(protocol.underlying),
        controller.getCurveParams(address(vaultCurrency), protocol.underlying)
      );
```
This line calls the `Swap.swapStableCoins()` function, which performs arithmetic operations that could cause an integer overflow or underflow, Specifically, the `uScale` and `controller.underlyingUScale(protocol.underlying)` values are used as arguments to the `Swap.swapStableCoins()` function, and if either of these values is too large or too small, an arithmetic operation could result in an unexpected value or an error.

And this vulnerability occurs due to the lack of checking for integer overflow and underflow in the contract. The issue arises in the `depositInProtocol()` function, where the `_amount` variable is multiplied by "uScale", and the result is divided by `controller.underlyingUScale(protocol.underlying)` without any check for overflow.

For example, suppose an attacker transfers a large value of `_amount` that causes an overflow in the multiplication operation, leading to a wrong calculation of the final amount. The attacker can then withdraw more tokens than the balance of the contract, resulting in a financial loss for the contract.

Similarly, the `withdrawFromProtocol()` function uses the same arithmetic operation, leading to a similar vulnerability, the attacker can withdraw more tokens than the contract's balance, causing financial loss to the contract.

## Impact
An attacker could exploit this to cause the deposit and withdrawal functions to fail or behave unpredictably.
An attacker could steal funds from the contract or cause it to become inoperable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Implement a library such as SafeMath or similar for integer arithmetic operations to prevent integer overflow and underflow.
2. Add bounds checking to ensure that inputs are within acceptable ranges before performing arithmetic operations.
3. Add validation checks to ensure that the arithmetic operations are behaving as intended.
