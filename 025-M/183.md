# Integer division which can cause rounding errors

## Summary
Several parts of the code utilize integer division, which can lead to rounding errors, particularly, the `withdrawFromProtocol()` function employs an integer division to compute the number of shares to be withdrawn. However, this division may result in rounding errors.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    _amount = (_amount * protocol.uScale) / uScale; // in withdrawFromProtocol()
```
This line performs integer division, which can cause rounding errors, the code converts the `_amount` to a value in terms of the protocol's internal units `(protocol.uScale)`, which is then used to calculate the number of shares to withdraw, If this calculation has rounding errors, it can result in the withdrawal of the wrong number of shares, leading to incorrect accounting and potentially causing losses.

And the vulnerability arises due to the use of integer division in several parts of the code, leading to rounding errors, One example is in the `withdrawFromProtocol()` function, where the `_amount` variable is divided by `uScale`, As a result, rounding errors can occur in the division process, leading to incorrect calculations of the token amount that the user is attempting to withdraw.

The vulnerable code snippets that use integer division are:

```solidity
    uint256 underlyingBalance = (IProvider(protocol.provider).balanceUnderlying(
      address(this),
      protocol.LPToken
    ) * uScale) / protocol.uScale; // in balanceUnderlying()
```

```solidity
    uint256 shares = IProvider(protocol.provider).calcShares(
      (_amount * protocol.uScale) / uScale,
      protocol.LPToken
    ); // in calcShares()
```
## Impact
An attacker may exploit the rounding error in the `withdrawFromProtocol()` function to withdraw more funds than they are entitled to, resulting in a loss of funds. Moreover, rounding errors may cause discrepancies in the calculated balance in `VaultCurrency`, resulting in inaccurate reporting of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a fixed-point library or multiply by a large number to avoid rounding errors. 

The following code changes can be implemented to address this vulnerability:

1. Use a fixed-point library instead of integer division, this will allow for accurate and precise calculations without rounding errors.
2. Alternatively, multiply the dividend by a large number before division, to avoid rounding errors, this method is less optimal than using a fixed-point library, but it will reduce the chances of rounding errors.
