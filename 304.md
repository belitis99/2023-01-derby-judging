# MainVault.sol : `deposit, withdraw` - funds could be lost if `receiver` is not specified.

## Summary

Current implementation is done such that for deposit and withdraw, the funds are sent to receiver which is one of the argument for deposit and withdraw.
Users are forced to send the receiver. There are chances that user may miss or specify incorrect address, if this is the case, the fund would lost forever.
Even though front end can have provision to avoid this, still it is possible when user calls the function directly.

## Vulnerability Detail
[deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L106) and [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L131) functions takes receiver as one of the argument which will receive the funds.

If the receiver address is missed to specify by mistake, funds would be lost forever.

## Impact

User would suffer permanent loss
