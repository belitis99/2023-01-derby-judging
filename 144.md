# M-02 Rebalancing with wrong values

## Summary
From the **README** 
**Guardian**: the guardian is there to manually restart the protocol when it's stuck during rebalancing or cross-chain rebalancing. The guardian is controlled by a single entity because it needs to be able to act quickly.

So we know that the **Guardian** should be able to restart the protocol manually when it's stuck during cross-chain rebalancing.

## Vulnerability Detail
When you invoke the function `pushAllocationsToController()` is to pushes the  `totalDeltaAllocations` from **Game** to **xChainController**
Also, it calls `allocationsToArray()` internally and in turn it set all the **deltaAllocationChain** to zero

```solidity
  function allocationsToArray(uint256 _vaultNumber) internal returns (int256[] memory deltas) {
    deltas = new int[](chainIds.length);

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < chainIds.length; i++) {
      uint32 chain = chainIds[i];
      deltas[i] = getDeltaAllocationChain(_vaultNumber, chain);
      vaults[_vaultNumber].deltaAllocationChain[chain] = 0;
    }
  }
```
The  `pushAllocations()` uses `xcall()` to do the cross-chain message. If the call on the receiver contract reverts because of the `onlyWhenReady()` modifier on **xChainController** or a stuck during cross-chain message

The **Guardian** should be able to restart the protocol manually
He has the ability to invoke `pushAllocationsToController()` at anytime because this `rebalanceNeeded()`
Also, he can call `setRebalancingPeriod()` to set the rebalancing period for vaultNumber to the right number

But the `allocationsToArray()` will return an empty array. Because all the deltas are deleted on the first try   

**NOTE**
The same thing could happen with `pushAllocationsToVaults()`
because `protocolAllocationsToArray()` delete the values of the `deltaAllocationProtocol`
## Impact
**xChainController** will receive an  empty array (deltas) and that will lead the protocol to not working properly (rebalancing with wrong values)

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function pushAllocationsToController(uint256 _vaultNumber) external payable {
    require(rebalanceNeeded(), "No rebalance needed");
    for (uint k = 0; k < chainIds.length; k++) {
      require(
        getVaultAddress(_vaultNumber, chainIds[k]) != address(0),
        "Game: not a valid vaultnumber"
      );
      require(
        !isXChainRebalancing[_vaultNumber][chainIds[k]],
        "Game: vault is already rebalancing"
      );
      isXChainRebalancing[_vaultNumber][chainIds[k]] = true;
    }

    int256[] memory deltas = allocationsToArray(_vaultNumber);
    IXProvider(xProvider).pushAllocations{value: msg.value}(_vaultNumber, deltas);

    lastTimeStamp = block.timestamp;
    vaults[_vaultNumber].rebalancingPeriod++;

    emit PushedAllocationsToController(_vaultNumber, deltas);
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`allocationsToArray()` should not set `deltaAllocationChain` to zeros in this step
