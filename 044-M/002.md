# User fund loss when rebalancingPeriod is not initialized

## Summary
When a new MainVault is deployed, rebalancingPeriod is not initialized equal to 0. If Alice deposits some funds by calling [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L106) and gets some lptokens, then she calls [withdrawalRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L149) multiple times to make an appointment to withdraw funds at the period of the next rebalance. Finally she can only get the funds at the last call to withdrawalRequest.
## Vulnerability Detail
This issue only occurs when the new MainVault is just deployed. Let's assume as following:

1.  Alice calls deposit and gets 100e18 lptoken.
2.  Alice calls withdrawalRequest(40e18).
    
    ```solidity
    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;	//user.withdrawalAllowance = 40e18 * exchangeRate
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;	//user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = 0
    ```
    
3.  Alice calls withdrawalRequest(60e18) again.
    
    ```solidity
    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;	//user.withdrawalAllowance = 60e18 * exchangeRate
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;	//user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = 0
    ```
    
4.  Finally alice lose some fund which equal to 40e18 * exchangeRate.
## Impact
There is a risk of users losing funds, but the probability is not very high, it only happens when an new MainVault is just deployed.
## Code Snippet
The code is located [[here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L149-L162)].

```solidity
function withdrawalRequest(
    uint256 _amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");	//this check is passed

    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);

    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;			//overwrite user.withdrawalAllowance
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;	//rebalancingPeriod=0 when new vault is deployed
    totalWithdrawalRequests += value;
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Two ways will fix this issue:
- Initialize rebalancingPeriod in the MainVault constructor to make it greater than 0.
- [[require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L153)]Â => `require(user.withdrawalAllowance == 0, "Already a request");`
