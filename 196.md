# Precision loss in the state variable `savedTotalUnderlying`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
On [pullFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L111-L127) If this condition is `false`
```solidity
uint256 amountToWithdraw = shortage > balanceProtocol ? balanceProtocol : shortage;
```
the `amountToWithdraw` get the value of `shortage`
the **shortage** is how much the `vault` still need to achieve all the required value from `xChainController`

If `amountToWithdraw < minimumPull` is `true`
You don't need to decrease `savedTotalUnderlying`. so this line should be after the if condition.
```solidity
savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;
```

## Impact
Precision loss in the state variable `savedTotalUnderlying`

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
  function pullFunds(uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;

      uint256 shortage = _value - vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this));
      uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(i);

      uint256 amountToWithdraw = shortage > balanceProtocol ? balanceProtocol : shortage;
-     savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;

      if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) break;
+   savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;
      withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw);

      if (_value <= vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this))) break;
    }
  }
