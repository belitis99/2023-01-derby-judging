# Game.sol#L31 : mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => int256)) allocations;  is not implemented as how the comment says. Not clear.

## Summary

The basket has one of the parameter for allocation.

       mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => int256)) allocations;

The comment says, the mapping is like `vaultNumber => chainId => allocation`

But in the implementation it is done like `chainId => vaultNumber => allocation`

## Vulnerability Detail

Refer the summary section

## Impact

If mapping is based on `vaultNumber => chainId => allocation` , all the implementation which are using the `allocation` would end with incorrect working behavior.

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Not sure whether it is type error. If not, correct the code and update in other places.
