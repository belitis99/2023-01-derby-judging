# Manipulate Allocations from game using flashloans

## Summary
A user can use flashloans to leverage the amount of derby token dedicated towards a certain protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario:
A malicious user wants to manipulate DeltaAllocations to change the weight of some protocol inside vault.
This works because the user can call pushAllocationsToController and pushAllocationsToVaults in the same transaction.

1. They take a flashloan of USDC
2. Swap the USDC into derby token on some dex
3. Rebalance there basket using these tokens
4. Call pushAllocationsToController
5. Call pushAllocationsToVaults
6. Rebalance there basket to get tokens back
7. Swap tokens to USDC
8. pay back loan

## Impact
A User can use this to stake tokens into bad performing protocols, leading to possible lose of funds or unexpected behavior.
