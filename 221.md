# Vault Provider contracts may does not work with fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
Certain tokens (e.g., STA or PAXG) charge a fee for transfers and others (e.g., USDT or USDC) may start doing so in the future. This is not correctly handled in Vault Provider contracts. There are a lot of unpredictable things happening in the blockchain and in the field of stablecoins, so nothing is impossible.

## Vulnerability Detail
deposit function in the Vault Provider contracts maybe does not work well with fee-on-transfer tokens, for example, USDT.

for now, you are using the below pattern for the deposit :

>     uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(address(this));
> 
>     IERC20(_uToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
>     IERC20(_uToken).safeIncreaseAllowance(_yToken, _amount);
> 
>     uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(address(this));
>     require((balanceAfter - balanceBefore - _amount) == 0, "Error Deposit: under/overflow");
> 
>     uint256 yTokenReceived = IYearn(_yToken).deposit(_amount);
>     IYearn(_yToken).transfer(msg.sender, yTokenReceived);

assume that you are using stablecoin USDT with a 1% fee on transfers. user will call the deposit with 100 USDT. at the end of the transaction, the contract will receive 99 USDT tokens.

The balance before is 200, the user will make a deposit of 100 USDT, balance after is 299. now  

> require((balanceAfter - balanceBefore - _amount) == 0, "Error Deposit: under/overflow") = 
> require((299 - 200 - 100) == 0, "Error Deposit: under/overflow"); 

will return an error and you can't make a deposit to the vault provider. even if you can reach the deposit function, the contract will deposit amount = 100 USDT and not the amount = 99 USDT. so if the contract has not had enough USDT balance, the deposit transaction will get reverted.

let's see how Yean Finance is managing this problem. at yVault.sol#L79, amount get calculated by  _amount = _after.sub(_before).

>         uint256 _pool = balance();
>         uint256 _before = token.balanceOf(address(this));
>         token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
>         uint256 _after = token.balanceOf(address(this));
>         _amount = _after.sub(_before); // Additional check for deflationary tokens

## Impact
If you are using tokens or stablecoins that may charge fees on your transactions in the future, the current code will not support the use of these tokens.

I used High label because If any stablecoin decides to use fees on their transfers, your contract will not work anymore and you can pause the contract because you don't implement pause and unpause functions on them.
