# `Vault::claimTokens` uniswap swaps can be abused

## Summary
`Vault::claimTokens` trades with uniswap at any price. This can be abused by others to do trades stealing value from vault stakers and game players.

## Vulnerability Detail
Uniswap quoter uses 0 as `sqrtPriceLimitX96` which lets `Vault` trade at any price:

Since `Vault::claimTokens` is public and can be called by anyone this can be abused by traders to wrap token claims in sandwich trades.

## Impact
Claiming reward tokens from protocols can be stolen by wrapping them in sandwich trades.
