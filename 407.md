# `Swap::swapStableCoins` assumes 1:1 price

## Summary
`Swap::swapStableCoins` assumes 1:1 price

## Vulnerability Detail
`amountOutMin` for the stablecoin swap is calculated like this:

This essentially says that the value during a deposit must be >1:1 or <1:1 during a withdrawal. This is a bit risky since stable coins can move against eachother.

This might cause deposits and withdrawals in protocols with other underlying stable coins to fail, in turn causing rebalance to fail.

## Impact
A deposit or withdraw might not be possible if price has moved against the vault just a little. This can cause rebalance to fail and have to wait until the price has moved up/down a little.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow a buffer for the stablecoins to move within, like within 99%
