# `XProvider` forces increased relayer fees when transferring tokens cross-chain

## Summary
When transferring tokens cross-chain, `XProvider` sends two cross-chain message, while only one can be sent. Whoever triggers cross-chain token transfers (which are required to complete rebalancing) will pay relayer fees twice.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol integrates with Connext to handle cross-chain interactions. [XProvider](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L14) is a contract that manages interactions between vaults deployed on all supported networks and `XChainController`. `XProvider` is deployed on each of the network where a vault is deployed and is used to send and receive cross-chain messages via Connext. Among other things, `XProvider` handles cross-chain token transfers during vaults rebalancing:
1. [xTransferToController](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L321) transfers funds from a vault to the `XChainController`;
1. [xTransferToVaults](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L362) transfers funds from the `XChainController` to a vault.

The two functions, besides sending tokens, also update the state in the destination contract:
1. `xTransferToController` [calls `XChainController.upFundsReceived`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L333) to update the counter of vaults that have sent tokens to `XChainController`;
1. `xTransferToVaults` [calls `Vault.receiveFunds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L374) to set a "funds received" flag in the vault.

Both sending tokens and triggering a state change send a cross-chain message by calling `IConnext.xcall`:
1. `xSend` [calls `IConnext.xcall`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L115) and sends relayer fee along the call;
1. `xTransfer` sends tokens by [calling `IConnext.xcall`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L152), and it also requires paying relayer fee.

Thus, the caller of `xTransferToController` and `xTransferToVaults` will have to pay double relayer fee. Since these functions are mandatory for rebalancing, the extra fee will have to be paid by the guardian or any actor who manages vaults rebalancing. However, Connext allows to transfer tokens and make arbitrary calls in one message, while paying relayer fee only once.
## Impact
`xTransferToController` and `xTransferToVaults` incur double relayer fees on the caller. The extra cost will have to be paid by whoever manages rebalancing.
## Code Snippet
1. `xTransferToController` calls `xTransfer` and `pushFeedbackToXController`–both of them create a cross-chain message:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L321
1. `xTransferToVaults` calls `xTransfer` and `pushFeedbackToVault`–both of them create a cross-chain message:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L362
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
According to [the documentation of Connext](https://docs.connext.network/concepts/how-it-works/transaction-flow), the `_callData` argument of `xcall` doesn't need to be empty when transferring tokens: `xReceive` can handle both of them together:
```solidity
function xReceive(
    bytes32 _transferId,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _asset,
    address _originSender,
    uint32 _origin,
    bytes memory _callData
) external returns (bytes memory) {
    // Check for the right token
    require(
      _asset == address(token),
      "Wrong asset received"
    );

    // Enforce a cost to update the greeting
    require(
      _amount > 0,
      "Must pay at least 1 wei"
    );

    // Unpack the _callData
    string memory newGreeting = abi.decode(_callData, (string));
    _updateGreeting(newGreeting);
}
```

Also, judging by the implementation of the Connext contract, [the passed calldata is executed even when tokens are transferred](https://github.com/connext/monorepo/blob/87b75b346664271522e2f2acfd10bebcfeb93993/packages/deployments/contracts/contracts/core/connext/facets/BridgeFacet.sol#L833-L837):
```solidity
// transfer funds to recipient
AssetLogic.handleOutgoingAsset(_asset, _args.params.to, _amountOut);

// execute the calldata
_executeCalldata(_transferId, _amountOut, _asset, _reconciled, _args.params);
```

Thus, in `xTransferToController` and `xTransferToVaults`, consider passing the calldata of the second calls to `xTransfer`.
