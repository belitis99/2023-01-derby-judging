# lack of initialization of rebalanceInterval could allow to a user malicious take advanatge to this

## Summary
function setRebalance Interval can be victim of attack front run
## Vulnerability Detail

due that  rebalanceInterval

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L62

does't is set in constructor the value initial is  0

this can allow a user,an attack front run to

setRebalanceInterval

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L604-L606



first call

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L318-L333

then call again 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L318-L333

and call
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L424-L445

and  so increment 

vaults[_vaultNumber].rebalancingPeriod++;

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L442


then call 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L465-L477

then repeat this attack and call 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L318-L333

this allow, bypass this 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L375

and so addToTotalRewards for the user
## Impact
this is a behavior no wished in the  protocol and a malicious user  can take advantage to this

## Recommendation
set a  value of  rebalanceInterval  in constructor
