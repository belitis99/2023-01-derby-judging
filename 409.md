# Protocols that are blacklisted cannot be whitelisted again

## Summary

Protocols that are blacklisted cannot be whitelisted again.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vault can blacklist a protocol by calling  `setProtocolBlacklist()`. However, it cannot revert the change.

```solidity
  /// @notice Setter for protocol blacklist, given an vaultnumber and protocol number puts the protocol on the blacklist. Can only be called by vault.
  /// @param _vaultNumber Number of the vault
  /// @param _protocolNum Protocol number linked to protocol vault
  function setProtocolBlacklist(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint256 _protocolNum
  ) external override onlyVault {
    protocolBlacklist[_vaultNumber][_protocolNum] = true;
  }
```

## Impact

Protocols that are blacklisted cannot be whitelisted again.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend adding a parameter like `isBlacklist` so that the vault has the option to revert its blacklist, in case it does it accidentally.
```solidity
  function setProtocolBlacklist(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint256 _protocolNum
+   bool isBlacklist
  ) external override onlyVault {
    protocolBlacklist[_vaultNumber][_protocolNum] = isBlacklist;
  }
```
