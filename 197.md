# The vault will send lower values, even if it can provide the required amount from `xChainController`.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
On [pullFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L111-L127) If the this condition is `true`
```solidity
uint256 amountToWithdraw = shortage > balanceProtocol ? balanceProtocol : shortage;
```
That's means the `amountToWithdraw` value is less than `shortage`
So the vault should keep withdrawing From Protocols

But if this condition is `true`
```solidity
if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) break;
```
only means the value of the `vault` on the `i` Protocol is `< minimumPull`
```solidity
uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(I);
```
This will just `break` even if the vault can provide the required amount from `xChainController`.
 and the `rebalanceXChain()` will only send the available balance on this vault to `xChainController`

## Impact
The vault will send lower values, even if it can provide the required amount from `xChainController`.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You need to make sure there are no funds in the rest protocols to `if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) break; `
