# rebalanceXChain can be called by without slippage protection and can cause trades with bad exchange rates

## Summary

`rebalanceXChain` can be called by anyone with any slippage and can cause trades with bad exchange rates.

## Vulnerability Detail

`function rebalanceXChain(uint256 _slippage, uint256 _relayerFee) external payable {` is external and doesnâ€™t have any access control. Adversary can call this when Vault state is `SendingFundsXChain`. She can call it with any slippage she wants.

1. Wait for the DAO to set suitable `amountToSendXChain`.
2. call `rebalanceXChain` with 100% slippage. 
3. See tokens transferred to XConnect via `XProvider.xTransferToController`
4. Flash loan the XConnect swap pool to take profit from the 100% slippage trade

## Impact

Adversary can get a 100% slippage trade from the Project's funds

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function rebalanceXChain(uint256 _slippage, uint256 _relayerFee) external payable {
  require(state == State.SendingFundsXChain, stateError);

  if (amountToSendXChain > getVaultBalance()) pullFunds(amountToSendXChain);
```

## Recommendation

Restrict `rebalanceXChain` as onlyDAO, or use a max slippage requirement.
