# Blacklisting a protocol leads to lower allocations

## Summary
Blacklisting a protocol does not update (decrease) the totalAllocatedTokens. It is used to calculate the new allocations and if it is larger than it should be it will lead to lower token allocations to protocols and lower yield.
## Vulnerability Detail
Blacklisting does not touch the variable (it decreases the currentAllocations[_protocolNum] but not the total)

totalAllocatedTokens is only modified by delta allocations, there is no fix to it.

The protocol allocation is calculated hereby, decreased by totalAllocatedTokens value.

## Impact
Forever decreased token allocations to protocols and lower yield.

totalAllocatedTokens by the zeroed currentAllocations[_protocolNum]
