# Blaclisting a protocol between rebalacings may distort the allocations.

## Summary
Allocation deltas are collected between rebalancings. If there is some delta dedicated to a protocol that gets blacklisted, this delta will be ignored and the allocations to other protocols will end up having wrong values.
## Vulnerability Detail
The blacklisting does not touch deltas.

Blacklisted protocols are ignored for allocations

Which results in part of the allocatable funds not being used that should have been used for the live protocols.
## Impact
Wrong allocations to protocols and inferior yield.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In blacklistProtocol(_protocolNum), zero the deltaAllocations[_protocolNum] and lower deltaAllocatedTokens accordingly.
