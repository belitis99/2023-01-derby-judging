# An attacker can steal tokens from the contract and cause the contract to behave unexpectedly.

## Summary
`IdleProvider` includes a deposit function that is vulnerable to a re-entrancy attack due to the presence of external calls that transfer tokens to and from the contract. An attacker could potentially call the deposit function repeatedly before the state changes have been completed, allowing the attacker to perform additional operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability occurs in the deposit function where the external call to `IIdle(_iToken).mintIdleToken(_amount, true, address(0))` can be exploited by a malicious actor to perform additional operations before the state changes have been completed, this can allow the attacker to repeatedly call the function and transfer tokens to/from the contract, resulting in a re-entrancy attack.

```solidity
IIdle(_iToken).mintIdleToken(_amount, true, address(0));
```
In the deposit function, the contract pulls underlying assets from the Vault and deposits them into Idle. It then sends `tTokens` back. 

The steps involved in the deposit function are:

1. Check the balance of the contract before the transfer and increase the allowance of the `iToken`.
2. Perform the transfer of the underlying asset from the sender to the contract.
3. Perform the deposit operation in Idle by calling the `mintIdleToken` function and passing the amount to deposit.
4. Transfer the `tTokens` back to the sender.

The `mintIdleToken` function is the "expensive" operation in this function as it can execute external calls that can trigger the re-entrancy attack. This function mints a new amount of `tTokens` in exchange for the deposited underlying asset.

The issue is that the function call to `mintIdleToken` is not atomic, which means that the function execution can be paused before it is completed, and the control flow can be transferred to another function before the state changes are recorded. This allows a malicious actor to repeatedly call the deposit function before the state changes are completed.

An attacker can create a contract that calls the deposit function multiple times before the state changes are completed. Each time the deposit function is called, the attacker's contract can execute its own code, potentially performing additional operations that can drain the contract's funds.

## Impact
This can allow an attacker to steal tokens from the contract and cause the contract to behave unexpectedly. An attacker can potentially drain the funds from the contract and make it insolvent. This can lead to a total loss of funds for the users of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract should be modified to use a "mutex" or a "re-entrancy" guard to prevent `re-entrancy` attacks. In this case, a mutex can be used to prevent multiple calls to the deposit function before the state changes are recorded.

The following modifications can be made to the contract to fix the vulnerability:

1. Add a "mutex" to the deposit function that prevents multiple calls to the function before the state changes are recorded.
2. Move the `mintIdleToken` function call to the end of the deposit function to ensure that all state changes are recorded before the function executes.
4. Add a "re-entrancy" guard to the `mintIdleToken` function to prevent external calls during execution.
