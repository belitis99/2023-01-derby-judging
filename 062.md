# Vault doesn't claim rewards when a protocol is blacklisted

## Summary
When a protocol is blacklisted through the vault, the deposit is withdrawn but the rewards aren't claimed.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Vault.blacklistProtocol()` the contract doesn't call the provider's `claim()` function before withdrawing the vault's deposit. Any accumulated rewards are potentially lost. This is relevant only for a subset of protocols where rewards have to be manually claimed.

## Impact
Loss of accumulated rewards.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L475-L483
```sol
  /// @notice The DAO should be able to blacklist protocols, the funds should be sent to the vault.
  /// @param _protocolNum Protocol number linked to an underlying vault e.g compound_usdc_01
  function blacklistProtocol(uint256 _protocolNum) external onlyGuardian {
    uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(_protocolNum);
    currentAllocations[_protocolNum] = 0;
    controller.setProtocolBlacklist(vaultNumber, _protocolNum);
    savedTotalUnderlying -= balanceProtocol;
    withdrawFromProtocol(_protocolNum, balanceProtocol);
  }
```

`claim()` is executed everytime the vault is rebalanced: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L402-L419
```sol
  /// @notice Harvest extra tokens from underlying protocols
  /// @dev Loops over protocols in ETF and check if they are claimable in controller contract
  function claimTokens() public {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;
      bool claim = controller.claim(vaultNumber, i);
      if (claim) {
        address govToken = controller.getGovToken(vaultNumber, i);
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20(govToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        Swap.swapTokensMulti(
          Swap.SwapInOut(tokenBalance, govToken, address(vaultCurrency)),
          controller.getUniswapParams(),
          false
        );
      }
    }
  }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Claim the protocol rewards before withdrawing.
