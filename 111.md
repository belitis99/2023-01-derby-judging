# missing deadline and deadline checker in xTransfer

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
xTransfer should have a deadline and deadline checker implemented to ensure that the transaction is completed within a reasonable amount of time since it transfers funds from one chain to another.

## Impact
The xTransfer function appears to be transferring tokens using the Connext protocol, which likely involves exchanging tokens across different blockchains. In this case, it may be beneficial to include a deadline and deadline checker to ensure that the transaction is completed within a reasonable amount of time
Without a deadline and deadline checker, there is a risk that the transaction may take longer than expected
