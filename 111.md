# missing deadline and deadline checker in xTransfer() and swapStableCoins()

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
These functions should have a deadline and deadline checker implemented to ensure that the transaction is completed within a reasonable amount of time since it transfers funds from one chain to another like the xTransfer()

i think it's the same case for swapStableCoin()

## Impact
The xTransfer() function appears to be transferring tokens using the Connext protocol, which likely involves exchanging tokens across different blockchains. In this case, it may be beneficial to include a deadline and deadline checker to ensure that the transaction is completed within a reasonable amount of time.
Same for the swapStableCoins() function which swaps stable coins on curve.
Without a deadline and deadline checker, there is a risk that the transaction may take longer than expected

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
implement a deadline and deadline checker so that users can have control over the duration of the tx.
