# Contract does not enforce that the negativeRewardThreshold is actually negative

## Summary
The Game contract does not enforce that the `negativeRewardThreshold` which is required to always be negative is actually negative  

## Vulnerability Detail

Even though it is stated in the documentation that the `negativeRewardThreshold` must be negative, it is not actually enforced in the code and because the parameter can be controlled by the Dao, it is possible for the Dao to set it to a positive value, and that will make the `redeemNegativeRewards` function unusable. For more details follow the screenshot below.

If the `negativeRewardThreshold` is positive and `unredeemedReward` is greater, then the check on line 301 above will not return, when that occurs line 303 will always revert due to `uint` getting a negative number (`+` and `-` becomes `-`), this will make the `redeemNegativeRewards` function unusable and puts the user funds at risk of being inaccessible.

## Impact
Not enforcing that the `negativeRewardThreshold` is always negative, could lead to the loss of user funds, since the `redeemNegativeRewards` is imperative to the redemption process

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enforce that the `negativeRewardThreshold` is always negative by adding the following check before setting the value
```solidity
/// @notice Setter for threshold at which user tokens will be sold / burned
  /// @param _threshold treshold in vaultCurrency e.g USDC, must be negative
  function setNegativeRewardThreshold(int256 _threshold) external onlyDao {
    require(_threshold < 0, "Threshold must be negative");
    negativeRewardThreshold = _threshold;
  }

```
