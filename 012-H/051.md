# ``pullFunds()`` might give the wrong account for ``savedTotalUnderlying``.

## Summary
The ``pullFunds()`` function might give the wrong account for ``savedTotalUnderlying``.  The problem is when the amount to withdraw from an underlying protocol is small (``amountToWithdraw < minimumPull``), that protocol is skipped, and no withdrawal will be made; however, this amount is still deducted from ``savedTotalUnderlying``.

Another source of error is that ``withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw)`` might actually withdraw less amount than ``amountToWithdraw`` when the underlying balance is not sufficient to cover ``amountToWithdraw``. However, even in this case, the amount of ``amountToWithdraw``  is still deducted from ``savedTotalUnderlying``.

Impact: each time when ``pullFunds()`` is called, the ``savedTotalUnderlying`` account might be off by ``minimumPull`` for each protocol, the accumulative error might be huge in the long run. Therefore, I rank this as a "H" due to the accumulative damage impact to the protocol. 
 

## Vulnerability Detail
The ``pullFunds()`` function is used to withdraw from protocols on shortage in Vault.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L111-L127](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L111-L127)

However, the following lines of code show that when ``amountToWithdraw < minimumPull``, no amount will be withdrawn from the protocol, but ``amountToWithdraw`` will still be deducted from 
``savedTotalUnderlying``. As a result,  ``amountToWithdraw`` could be off by ``amountToWithdraw`` for each protocol. 

```javascript
uint256 amountToWithdraw = shortage > balanceProtocol ? balanceProtocol : shortage;
      savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;

      if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) break;
      withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw);
```
In addition, L123 below might actually withdraw less amount than ``amountToWithdraw`` when the underlying balance is not sufficient to cover ``amountToWithdraw``. However, even in this case, the amount of ``amountToWithdraw``  is still deducted from ``savedTotalUnderlying``.

```javascript
withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw);
```
In the long run, this might lead to huge accumulative error. 

## Impact
The ``pullFunds()`` function might give the wrong account for ``savedTotalUnderlying``. This might lead to accumulative error in ``savedTotalUnderlying`` in the long run.

## Recommendation
We will not deduct ``amountToWithdraw``  when there is no withdrawl for a protocol. We also changed ``withdrawFromProtocol()`` to return the actual withdrawl amount.

```diff
function pullFunds(uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;

      uint256 shortage = _value - vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this));
      uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(i);

      uint256 amountToWithdraw = shortage > balanceProtocol ? balanceProtocol : shortage;
-      savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;

      if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) break;
-      withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw);
+     uint256 actualWithdrawAmount =  withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw);
+      savedTotalUnderlying -= actualWithdrawAmount;


      if (_value <= vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this))) break;
    }
  }

- function withdrawFromProtocol(uint256 _protocolNum, uint256 _amount) internal 
+ function withdrawFromProtocol(uint256 _protocolNum, uint256 _amount) internal  returns(uint256 actualWithdrawAmount) {
+    uint256 balanceBefore = balanceUnderlying(i);

    if (_amount <= 0) return;
    IController.ProtocolInfoS memory protocol = controller.getProtocolInfo(
      vaultNumber,
      _protocolNum
    );

    _amount = (_amount * protocol.uScale) / uScale;
    uint256 shares = IProvider(protocol.provider).calcShares(_amount, protocol.LPToken);
    uint256 balance = IProvider(protocol.provider).balance(address(this), protocol.LPToken);

    if (shares == 0) return;
    if (balance < shares) shares = balance;

    IERC20(protocol.LPToken).safeIncreaseAllowance(protocol.provider, shares);
    uint256 amountReceived = IProvider(protocol.provider).withdraw(
      shares,
      protocol.LPToken,
      protocol.underlying
    );

    if (protocol.underlying != address(vaultCurrency)) {
      _amount = Swap.swapStableCoins(
        Swap.SwapInOut(amountReceived, protocol.underlying, address(vaultCurrency)),
        controller.underlyingUScale(protocol.underlying),
        uScale,
        controller.getCurveParams(protocol.underlying, address(vaultCurrency))
      );
    }
   
+    uint256 balanceBefore = balanceUnderlying(i);
+    return balanceBefore - balanceAfter;
  }
