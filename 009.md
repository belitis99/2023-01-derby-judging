# Did Not Approve To Zero First Causing Certain Token Transfer To Fail - USDT

## Summary
Allowance was not set to zero first before changing the allowance.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

The following attempt to call the approve() function without setting the allowance to zero first.

    IERC20(protocol.LPToken).safeIncreaseAllowance(protocol.provider, shares);
    uint256 amountReceived = IProvider(protocol.provider).withdraw(
      shares,
      protocol.LPToken,
      protocol.underlying
    );

## Impact
A number of features within the vaults will not work if the approve function reverts.

## Recommendation
