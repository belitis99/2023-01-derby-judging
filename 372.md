# setDeltaAllocationsInt() in the blacklist revert will cause the other also can not set

## Summary
one protocol in the blacklist revert will cause the other also can not to be set
## Vulnerability Detail
in setDeltaAllocationsInt() if _protocolNum in blacklist will revert
The code is as follows:
```solidity
  function setDeltaAllocationsInt(uint256 _protocolNum, int256 _allocation) internal {
    require(!controller.getProtocolBlacklist(vaultNumber, _protocolNum), "Protocol on blacklist"); //<----revert if in blacklist
    deltaAllocations[_protocolNum] += _allocation;
    deltaAllocatedTokens += _allocation;
  }

  function receiveProtocolAllocationsInt(int256[] memory _deltas) internal {
    for (uint i = 0; i < _deltas.length; i++) {
      int256 allocation = _deltas[i];
      if (allocation == 0) continue;
      setDeltaAllocationsInt(i, allocation);  //<----one in blacklist all will revert
    }

    deltaAllocationsReceived = true;
  }
```
If one of them is on the blacklist, all the others cannot be set
Because most contracts are cyclic operation protocol lists, it is impossible to skip individually
So it should be if in the blacklist, then the corresponding protocol _allocation can only be reduced and not increased such as:
` require(!controller.getProtocolBlacklist(vaultNumber, _protocolNum) || _allocation<=0, "Protocol on blacklist only reduced"); `
player can be reduced to 0

## Impact
one protocol in the blacklist revert will cause the other also can not to be set

## Recommendation

```solidity
  function setDeltaAllocationsInt(uint256 _protocolNum, int256 _allocation) internal {
-   require(!controller.getProtocolBlacklist(vaultNumber, _protocolNum), "Protocol on blacklist");
+   require(!controller.getProtocolBlacklist(vaultNumber, _protocolNum) || _allocation<=0, "Protocol on blacklist only reduced"); 
    deltaAllocations[_protocolNum] += _allocation;
    deltaAllocatedTokens += _allocation;
  }
