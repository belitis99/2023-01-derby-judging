# Missing zero address check can set _dao to zero address

## Summary
Missing zero address check can set _dao to zero address.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the constructor, we set the dao address to _dao input address, but we don't check the contract address of _dao before changing the storage variable. and the only way to make a change in the dao address is function setDao, and there is a modifier onlyDao on this function, so If the address is set to zero by mistake, nobody can change the dao address.

same is happening on Vault.sol contract.

## Impact
Missing zero address check can set _dao to zero address, which may allow dao to be mistakenly set to 0 and Need to redeploy contracts again.

I set the label to medium because If the address is entered incorrectly in the constructor method, there is no way to change it and you should pay the cost to redeploy again.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
create a function and in this function check that the input address is not zero, use this function everywhere need to make changes to the address or manually add a require() check for a zero address.
