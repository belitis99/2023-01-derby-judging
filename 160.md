# Missing deadline checks allow pending transactions to be mailciously executed

## Summary
The ```MainVault``` contract does not allow users to submit a deadline for there actions. In ```withdrawRewards()``` function there is a swap on Uniswap V3. This missing check enable pending transactions to be mailciously executed at a later point.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ```withdrawRewards()``` is used to withdraw the reward allowance set by the game with redeemRewardsGame. If the ```swapRewards``` is true, the protocol will  swap the vaultCurrency to derbyToken. The swap operations is performed on UniswapV3. AMMs provide their users with an option to limit the execution of their pending actions, such as swaps or adding and removing liquidity(for example see [Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L229) and [Uniswap V3](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/SwapRouter.sol#L119)). The most common solution is to include a deadline timestamp as a parameter.If such an option is not present ,users can unkowingly perform bad trades. The same issue for ```MainVault.claimTokens()```.

1.User wants to withdraw rewards , in the ```withdrawRewards()``` function the protocol swap vaultCurrency to derbyToken on Uniswap v3 .
2.The transaction is submitted to the mempool, however, user chose a transaction fee that is too low for miners to be interested in including her transaction in a block. The transaction stays pending in the mempool for extended periods, which could be hours, days, weeks, or even longer.
3.When the average gas fee dropped far enough for user's transaction to become interesting again for miners to include it, his swap will be executed. In the meantime, the price of token could have drastically changed. The output token might be significantly lower. He has unknowingly performed a bad trade due to the pending transaction she forgot about.

An even worse way this issue can be maliciously exploited is through MEV:

The transaction is still pending in the mempool. Average fees are still too high for miners to be interested in it. The price of token0 has gone up significantly since the transaction was signed, meaning the protocol would receive a lot more token1 when the swap is executed. But that also means that her maximum slippage value is outdated and would allow for significant slippage.
A MEV bot detects the pending transaction. Since the outdated maximum slippage value now allows for high slippage, the bot sandwiches the user, resulting in significant profit for the bot and significant loss for the user.
```solidity
function withdrawRewards() external nonReentrant onlyWhenIdle returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.rewardAllowance > 0, allowanceError);
    require(rebalancingPeriod > user.rewardRequestPeriod, "!Funds");

    value = user.rewardAllowance;
    value = checkForBalance(value);

    reservedFunds -= value;
    delete user.rewardAllowance;
    delete user.rewardRequestPeriod;

    if (swapRewards) {
      uint256 tokensReceived = Swap.swapTokensMulti(
        Swap.SwapInOut(value, address(vaultCurrency), derbyToken),
        controller.getUniswapParams(),
        true
      );
      IERC20(derbyToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, tokensReceived);
    } else {
      vaultCurrency.safeTransfer(msg.sender, value);
    }
  }
```
```solidity
function swapTokensMulti(
    SwapInOut memory _swap,
    IController.UniswapParams memory _uniswap,
    bool _rewardSwap
  ) public returns (uint256) {
    IERC20(_swap.tokenIn).safeIncreaseAllowance(_uniswap.router, _swap.amount);

    uint256 amountOutMinimum = IQuoter(_uniswap.quoter).quoteExactInput(
      abi.encodePacked(_swap.tokenIn, _uniswap.poolFee, WETH, _uniswap.poolFee, _swap.tokenOut),
      _swap.amount
    );

    uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_swap.tokenOut).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (_rewardSwap && balanceBefore > amountOutMinimum) return amountOutMinimum;

    ISwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = ISwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
      path: abi.encodePacked(
        _swap.tokenIn,
        _uniswap.poolFee,
        WETH,
        _uniswap.poolFee,
        _swap.tokenOut
      ),
      recipient: address(this),
      deadline: block.timestamp,
      amountIn: _swap.amount,
      amountOutMinimum: amountOutMinimum
    });

    ISwapRouter(_uniswap.router).exactInput(params);
    uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(_swap.tokenOut).balanceOf(address(this));

    return balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
  }
```
