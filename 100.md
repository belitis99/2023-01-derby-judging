# rebalanceXChain() can be called by anyone specifying a extreme high slippage

High

## Summary
Although the Mainvault `rebalanceXChain()` function can only be called in the `SendingFundsXChain` state, it does not provide any access control. One of the parameters is the slippage allowed when doing cross chain transfers.
During times of low liquidity in the Connext network an attacker (possibly a router wanting to benefit from the slippage) can call the function with an excessively high slippage  and cause loss for the protocol and its users. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The Mainvault's `rebalanceXChain()` function is meant to be called by a keeper bot maintained by the team. It does not however  have any access control and can be called by anyone when the system is in the `SendingFundsXChain` state. 
The parameter for slippage supplied by the caller is forwarded to the Provider contract and then 

## Impact
Cross chain rebalancing can be used by an attacker to create a loss for the protocol during low liquidity periods in the Connext network.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add access control so only the guardian can call the `rebalanceXChain()`
