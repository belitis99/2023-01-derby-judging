# Trusted provider can drain out funds in xProvider contract

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Use of low level "call" should be avoided whenever possible. If the call data is controllable, it is easy to cause arbitrary function execution. If the use of low-level "call" functions is necessary for a protocol or system, it is recommended to use a fixed function selector to restrict them. This can help ensure that only specific functions can be called with predetermined parameters, reducing the risk of exploitation.

## Impact
If an trusted provider is able to specify an arbitrary function signature, they could potentially call a function on the target contract that was not intended to be called, leading to unexpected behavior or drain out funds.
For example: 1. grant approve to attacker, 2 use transferfrom to drain out the funds.

```solidity
  /// @notice function implemented from IXReceive from connext, standard way to receive messages with connext.
  /// @param _transferId not used here because only relevant in case of a value transfer. Still in the signature to comply with IXReceive.
  /// @param _amount not used here because only relevant in case of a value transfer. Still in the signature to comply with IXReceive.
  /// @param _asset not used here because only relevant in case of a value transfer. Still in the signature to comply with IXReceive.
  /// @param _originSender sender contract.
  /// @param _origin sender domain id.
  /// @param _callData calldata, contains function signature which has to be called in this contract as well as the values, hashed and encoded.
  function xReceive(
    bytes32 _transferId,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _asset,
    address _originSender,
    uint32 _origin,
    bytes memory _callData
  ) external onlySource(_originSender, _origin) returns (bytes memory) {
    (bool success, ) = address(this).call(_callData); //@audit - arbitrary call injection.
    require(success, "xReceive: No success");
  }
