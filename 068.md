# No check for valid address when setting Dao

## Summary
There are no checks when setting the Dao address whether the address is valid

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
/// @notice Setter for DAO address
  /// @param _dao DAO address
  function setDao(address _dao) external onlyDao {
    dao = _dao;
  }
```
The set Dao function does not check whether the `_dao` argument is a zero address, therefore the `dao` could be accidentally or deliberately set to the zero address, which could make governance impossible. This is a serious issue because once the Dao is set in this way there is no way it can be undone.

## Impact
Setting the Dao to the zero address could make the contract unusable and lead to complete loss of user funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
require that the `_dao` argument is not the zero address
```solidity
/// @notice Setter for DAO address
  /// @param _dao DAO address
  function setDao(address _dao) external onlyDao {
    require(_dao != address(0), "DAO address cannot be 0");
    dao = _dao;
  }
```
