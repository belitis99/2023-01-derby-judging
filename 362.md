# withdraw() users may not be able to withdraw

## Summary
Forced vault is On may result in inability to withdraw
## Vulnerability Detail
Users can use `withdraw()` to make withdrawals:
The code is as follows:
```solidity
  function withdraw(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver,
    address _owner
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) { //<------vault mus on
    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    require(value > 0, "!value");

    require(getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds >= value, "!funds");

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    transferFunds(_receiver, value);
  }
```
This method has restrictions on the vault must be `On`
If none of the players vote on this vault in Game.sol 
it will be set to `Off` by XChainController
```solidity
  function settleCurrentAllocation(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint32 _chainId,
    int256 _deltas
  ) internal returns (uint256 activeVault) {
    if (getCurrentAllocation(_vaultNumber, _chainId) == 0 && _deltas == 0) {
      vaults[_vaultNumber].chainIdOff[_chainId] = true;   //<-----set to Off
      activeVault = 0;
    } else {
      vaults[_vaultNumber].chainIdOff[_chainId] = false;
      activeVault = 1;
    }
```

But the user deposit, should be allowed to withdraw, whether the player has voted or not

It makes more sense to use  `onlyWhenIdle`

## Impact
users may not be able to withdraw

## Recommendation
```solidity
  function withdraw(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver,
    address _owner
- ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
+ ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenIdle returns (uint256 value) {
    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    require(value > 0, "!value");

    require(getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds >= value, "!funds");

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    transferFunds(_receiver, value);
  }
```
