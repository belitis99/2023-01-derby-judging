# Protocol can't handle rewards of AAVE correctly

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
[storePriceAndRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L226-L256) is stores the historical price and the reward.
In case the protocol is AAVE the `price()` is always return `1`
```solidity
  /// @notice Exchange rate of underyling protocol token
  /// @dev Aave exchangeRate is always 1
  /// @param _aToken Address of protocol LP Token eg aUSDC
  /// @return price of LP token
  function exchangeRate(address _aToken) public pure override returns (uint256) {
    return 1;
  }
```
So the `rewardPerLockedToken` is always zero and 
 
## Impact
The protocol can't handle the rewards of AAVE correctly 
Users and Game players will lose rewards
