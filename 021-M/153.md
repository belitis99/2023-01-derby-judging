# Aave Liquidity Pools do not count towards rewards

c7e7eff
Medium
Submitted as Medium as it's not clear whether this is a Medium or a High according to the Sherlock rules. Personally I would categorize this as a High, but there is no direct loss of funds, only loss of expected funds.

## Summary
Aave tokens have a rebasing token model  where the exchange rate is always 1 (i.e. 1 LP token = 1 underlying token). 
As the calculation for rewards is based on the price difference over time, the rewards for Aave pools will always be 0. More broadly this applies to any vault using the rebasing model for their tokens when calculating rewards based on the evolution of the exchange rate.

## Vulnerability Detail
During rebalancing of the vaults the rewards are calculated in the `storePriceAndRewards()` function. The calculation is based on the price difference of the underlying LP token compared to the last rebalancing period (`priceDiff`). 
```solidity
  function storePriceAndRewards(uint256 _totalUnderlying, uint256 _protocolId) internal {
    uint256 currentPrice = price(_protocolId);
    if (lastPrices[_protocolId] == 0) {
      lastPrices[_protocolId] = currentPrice;
      return;
    }
    int256 priceDiff = int256(currentPrice - lastPrices[_protocolId]);
    int256 nominator = (int256(_totalUnderlying * performanceFee) * priceDiff);
    int256 totalAllocatedTokensRounded = totalAllocatedTokens / 1E18;
    int256 denominator = totalAllocatedTokensRounded * int256(lastPrices[_protocolId]) * 100;
...
	  rewardPerLockedToken[rebalancingPeriod][_protocolId] = nominator / denominator;
```
The price is determined by calling the `exchangeRate()` on the underlying Provider contract, which in the case of the Aave provider is always 1 (correctly so as Aave's LP token follows a rebasing model).
```solidity
  function exchangeRate(address _aToken) public pure override returns (uint256) {
    return 1;
  }
```

## Impact
Aave liquidity pools will never provide rewards for the game, which will cause players to avoid using Aave pools.

`Vault` calling the Provider's `exchangeRate()` to determine the price:

`AaveProvider` always returning 1 as exchange rate:

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Provide an alternative function on the `Provider` contracts which is independent of the underlying protocol's token model to indicate the performance of the pool. Then use that function to calculate the rewards in the `Vault` contract instead of the exchange rate.
