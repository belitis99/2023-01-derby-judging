# Aave rewards are never distributed

## Summary
On AaveProvider, exchangeRate is hardcoded to 1 which breaks distribution of rewards to allocators (rewards are never sent).

## Vulnerability Detail
As seen in balanceUnderlying:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/AaveProvider.sol#L103

exchangeRate is considered to be equal to 1, but this is inconsistent with the behavior of providers for other protocol and break the function of storePriceAndRewards:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L229-L250

since the price stays constant, the rewards are never accrued and are not distributed properly.

## Impact
Allocators never receive aave rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In aave provider, there should be a way to trigger reward accrual to take them in account in exchangeRate.
