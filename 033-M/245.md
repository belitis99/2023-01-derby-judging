### Loss of rewards due to multiple timed calls of rebalanceBasket

## Summary
It is possible for a user to lose their accrued rewards if the rebalanceBasket function is called multiple times preceeding and during a balance period.

## Vulnerability Detail
Assuming a newly initialized vault with a rebalancingPeriod of 0.
If we mint a new basket using mintNewBasket, then a new basket will be created with its lastRebalancingPeriod equal to vault.rebalancingPeriod+1 = 1

```solidity
function mintNewBasket(uint256 _vaultNumber) external returns (uint256) {
    baskets[latestBasketId].vaultNumber = _vaultNumber;
    baskets[latestBasketId].lastRebalancingPeriod = vaults[_vaultNumber].rebalancingPeriod + 1;
```

If we then deposit funds into the vault by calling rebalanceBasket when vault.rebalancingPeriod is zero and basket.lastRebalancingPeriod is one then the funds will be successfully deposited and basket.lastRebalancingPeriod will be set to vault.rebalancingPeriod+1 = 0+1 = 1 (unchanged) inside setBasketRebalancingPeriod. 

```solidity
  function rebalanceBasket(
    uint256 _basketId,
    int256[][] memory _deltaAllocations
  ) external onlyBasketOwner(_basketId) nonReentrant {
    uint256 vaultNumber = baskets[_basketId].vaultNumber;
    for (uint k = 0; k < chainIds.length; k++) {
      require(!isXChainRebalancing[vaultNumber][chainIds[k]], "Game: vault is xChainRebalancing");
    }

    addToTotalRewards(_basketId);
    int256 totalDelta = settleDeltaAllocations(_basketId, vaultNumber, _deltaAllocations);
    lockOrUnlockTokens(_basketId, totalDelta);
    setBasketTotalAllocatedTokens(_basketId, totalDelta);
    setBasketRebalancingPeriod(_basketId, vaultNumber);
  }

```

```solidity
  function setBasketRebalancingPeriod(
    uint256 _basketId,
    uint256 _vaultNumber
  ) internal onlyBasketOwner(_basketId) {
    baskets[_basketId].lastRebalancingPeriod = vaults[_vaultNumber].rebalancingPeriod + 1;
  }
```

During this initial call to rebalanceBasket, no rewards will be accumulated inside addToTotalRewards because nrOfAllocatedTokens is zero. 

```solidity
function addToTotalRewards(uint256 _basketId) internal onlyBasketOwner(_basketId) {
    if (baskets[_basketId].nrOfAllocatedTokens == 0) return;
```


During a vault rebalancing, when pushAllocationsToController (step 1) is called, isXChainRebalancing will be set to true and the vault.rebalancingPeriod will be set to 1. 

```solidity
  function pushAllocationsToController(uint256 _vaultNumber) external payable {
    require(rebalanceNeeded(), "No rebalance needed");
    for (uint k = 0; k < chainIds.length; k++) {
        //code abreviated for simplicity
        //...

      isXChainRebalancing[_vaultNumber][chainIds[k]] = true;
    }
    //code abreviated for simplicity
    //...

    vaults[_vaultNumber].rebalancingPeriod++;

  }
```

At this point rebalanceBasket will be blocked until pushAllocationsToVaults (step 6) is called which sets isXChainRebalancing for the chain back to false. 

```solidity
  function pushAllocationsToVaults(uint256 _vaultNumber, uint32 _chain) external payable {
    require(isXChainRebalancing[_vaultNumber][_chain], "Vault is not rebalancing");

    //code abreviated for simplicity
    //...

    isXChainRebalancing[_vaultNumber][_chain] = false;
  }
```

At this point, basket.lastRebalancingPeriod and vault.rebalancingPeriod will both be equal to 1. If a user now calls rebalanceBasket, rewards calculations from rebalancingPeriod 0-2 will be missed inside addToTotalRewards because currentRebalancingPeriod <= lastRebalancingPeriod (1<=1). 

```solidity
function addToTotalRewards(uint256 _basketId) internal onlyBasketOwner(_basketId) {
    if (baskets[_basketId].nrOfAllocatedTokens == 0) return;

    uint256 vaultNum = baskets[_basketId].vaultNumber;
    uint256 currentRebalancingPeriod = vaults[vaultNum].rebalancingPeriod;
    uint256 lastRebalancingPeriod = baskets[_basketId].lastRebalancingPeriod;

    if (currentRebalancingPeriod <= lastRebalancingPeriod) return;

    //rewards calculations are done here
    //..
```

Vault function rebalance (step 7) is later called which increments vault.rebalancingPeriod to 2. 
If rebalanceBasket was called after rebalance (step 7) was called then rewards would be calculated correctly for the rebalance period.

```solidity
 function rebalance() external nonReentrant {
    require(state == State.RebalanceVault, stateError);
    require(deltaAllocationsReceived, "!Delta allocations");

    rebalancingPeriod++;
```

## Impact
User rewards for a rebalancing cycle/two rebalancing periods will be lost. This would be a rather rare occurrence since the user call to rebalanceBasket would have to be done between pushAllocationsToVaults (step 6) and (step 7), however it would result in a loss of user accrued rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider incrementing vault.rebalancingPeriod inside settleReservedFunds since that is when the vaults state is set to State.RebalanceVault and vault rebalance is capable of being called.
