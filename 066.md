# Vault rebalance can cause deposits to revert

## Summary
If the vault doesn't pull enough funds from the protocols to cover expected withdrawals & rewards, subsequent deposits will revert

## Vulnerability Detail
The vault keeps track of expected withdrawals and reward payouts within a given period through the `reservedFunds` state variable. When the vault is rebalanced, it pulls funds from the protocols to cover that amount. But, there are edge cases where the vault does not gather enough funds:
1. vault encounters a protocol where it deposited more than 0 but less than 1,000,000 tokens
2. vault is short less than 1,000,000 tokens
In those two cases, the contract stops pulling funds and finishes the rebalances. That causes the vault to hold fewer tokens than `reservedFunds`.

In `deposit()`, that state triggers an underflow because of the following line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L116
```sol
    // @audit getVaultBalance() is ERC20(vaultCurrency).balanceOf(address(this))
    uint256 balanceBefore = getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;
```

Since the vault doesn't hold enough tokens to cover *all* of the withdrawals, this will also prevent users from executing their withdrawals.

## Impact
Rebalance can cause subsequent deposits to revert.

## Code Snippet
`pullFunds()` implements edge cases that cause the vault to hold less tokens than `reservedFunds`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L107-L126
```sol
  /// @notice Withdraw from protocols on shortage in Vault
  /// @dev Keeps on withdrawing until the Vault balance > _value
  /// @param _value The total value of vaultCurrency an user is trying to withdraw.
  /// @param _value The (value - current underlying value of this vault) is withdrawn from the underlying protocols.
  function pullFunds(uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;

      uint256 shortage = _value - vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this));
      uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(i);

      uint256 amountToWithdraw = shortage > balanceProtocol ? balanceProtocol : shortage;
      savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;

      if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) break;
      withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw);

      if (_value <= vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this))) break;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the edge cases so that the vault always has enough funds to cover all the withdrawals for a given period.
