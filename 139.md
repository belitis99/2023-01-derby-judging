2- Now he will invoke `rebalanceBasket()` to set the allocations into his basket.

After N periods. 
He will be surprised there are no rewards for him.

Bob could gain rewards with an existing `_vaultNumber`

## Impact

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function mintNewBasket(uint256 _vaultNumber) external returns (uint256) {
    // mint Basket with nrOfUnAllocatedTokens equal to _lockedTokenAmount
    baskets[latestBasketId].vaultNumber = _vaultNumber;
    baskets[latestBasketId].lastRebalancingPeriod = vaults[_vaultNumber].rebalancingPeriod + 1;
    _safeMint(msg.sender, latestBasketId);
    latestBasketId++;

    emit BasketId(msg.sender, latestBasketId - 1);
    return latestBasketId - 1;
  }
```
