## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
1- Bob is a Game player. he could invoke [mintNewBasket()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L255-L264) with the wrong `_vaultNumber` by mistakenly
2- Now he will invoke `rebalanceBasket()` to set the allocations into his basket.

He thinks he will start gaining rewards (if he set the right protocols). 
After N periods. 
He will be surprised there are no rewards for him.
If the `mintNewBasket()` check `_vaultNumber` is existing or not
Bob could gain rewards with an existing `_vaultNumber`

## Impact
The user will lose all his rewards

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function mintNewBasket(uint256 _vaultNumber) external returns (uint256) {
    // mint Basket with nrOfUnAllocatedTokens equal to _lockedTokenAmount
    baskets[latestBasketId].vaultNumber = _vaultNumber;
    baskets[latestBasketId].lastRebalancingPeriod = vaults[_vaultNumber].rebalancingPeriod + 1;
    _safeMint(msg.sender, latestBasketId);
    latestBasketId++;

    emit BasketId(msg.sender, latestBasketId - 1);
    return latestBasketId - 1;
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
the  `mintNewBasket()`  should revert if the `_vaultNumbe` is not existing.
