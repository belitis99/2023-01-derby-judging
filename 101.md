# Derby vault rebalance can fails exchange rate of protocol LP tokens decreases.

## Summary
During rebalancing of a Derby vault the price 
Whenever the exchange rate of an underlying protocol's LP token decreases the price difference calculation will revert because it overflows as the subtraction uses unsigned integers.

## Vulnerability Detail
During the rebalancing of  vault the `storePriceAndRewards()` function is called.
This calculates the price difference over time by subtracting two unsigned integers and converting it to a signed integer. The subtraction however will revert if the `lastPrice` is larger than the `currentPrice`
 
```solidity
int256 priceDiff = int256(currentPrice - lastPrices[_protocolId]);
```

The `currentPrice` is not guaranteed to be monotonically increasing. This fact is obviously known as it is the reason for using signed integers for the `priceDiff`.

## Impact
The rebalancing of a vault will fail if one of it's underlying LP token's price decreases.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify Vault.sol as follows: 
```diff
--      int256 priceDiff = int256(currentPrice - lastPrices[_protocolId]);
++      int256 priceDiff = int256(currentPrice) - int256(lastPrices[_protocolId]);
```
