# M-03 `getDecimals()` always call the MainNet

## Summary
`XChainController.pushVaultAmounts()` is to push `exchangeRate` to the vaults. 
`XChainController.getVaultAddress()` returns the  vault address of `vaultNumber` with the given `chainID`

## Vulnerability Detail
`pushVaultAmounts()` invoke `xProvider.getDecimals()` internally to calculate `newExchangeRate`

The [xProvider.getDecimals()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L487-L489) is always call the `address(vault)` from the MainNet. but `address(vault)` could be in any chain
`XChainController.pushVaultAmounts()` could keep reverting with all the `chainID` (only the MainNet will be correct )
or it will return the wrong `decimals` values. (if the `address(vault)` is for other chain/L but it exist in the MainNet with a `decimals()`)  
this will lead to a wrong `newExchangeRate`
```solidity
uint256 newExchangeRate = (totalUnderlying * (10 ** decimals)) / totalSupply;
```

## Impact
`pushVaultAmounts()` will keep reverting and this will break all rebalancing logic 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function pushVaultAmounts(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint16 _chain
  ) external payable onlyWhenUnderlyingsReceived(_vaultNumber) {
    address vault = getVaultAddress(_vaultNumber, _chain);
    require(vault != address(0), "xChainController: not a valid vaultnumber");
    /*...*/

    uint256 decimals = xProvider.getDecimals(vault);
    uint256 newExchangeRate = (totalUnderlying * (10 ** decimals)) / totalSupply;

    /*...*/
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You should invoke `getVaultAddress()` with `_chain` of the Mainnet. because all vaults have the same getDecimals (not all vaultNamber)
