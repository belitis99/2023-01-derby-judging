# Should not blacklist protocol when totalUnderlying is not withdrawn.

## Summary
`blacklistProtocol()` method does not validate that all amount is withdrawn from the protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
Guardian can call `blacklistProtocol()` method of Vault.sol.  `balanceProtocol` is total balance in the protocol and this amount is withdrawn from protocol into the vault in `blacklistProtocol()` . It is not guaranteed that each protocol successfully withdraw requested amount. This method will mark protocol blacklisted no matter full amount is withdrawn or not. 

## Impact
If partial withdraw happen during call to `blacklistProtocol()` then fund will stuck in protocol unless `Dao` add same protocol again.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing something along these lines
- `blacklistProtocol` function can be used to 
  - call withdrawFromProtocol
  - and update allocation to zero
  - and check `if(balanceUnderlying() > 0)` then only update totalUnderlying as such and update state/flag to user later as needed.
  - and mark blacklisted
- A dedicated withdraw function to withdraw fund from protocol which is 
  - blacklisted 
  - and has 0 allocation 
  - and has non-zero LP tokens in Vault.
