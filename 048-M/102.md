# Yearn withdrawal can revert making it impossible to rebalance the Derby vault

## Summary
Yearn has a default `maxLoss` of 0.01% on withdrawals. In certain cases where the amount to be withdrawn is large enough, the Yearn withdrawal will revert and cause the rebalance of the Derby vault to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Yearn `withdraw()` function has a `maxLoss` parameter which defaults to 0.01%. If this limit is reached the call reverts:
```vyper
def withdraw(
    maxShares: uint256 = MAX_UINT256,
    recipient: address = msg.sender,
    maxLoss: uint256 = 1,  # 0.01% [BPS]
) -> uint256:
    @param maxLoss
        The maximum acceptable loss to sustain on withdrawal. Defaults to 0.01%.
        If a loss is specified, up to that amount of shares may be burnt to cover losses on withdrawal.
...
	assert totalLoss <= maxLoss * (value + totalLoss) / MAX_BPS
```

Rebalancing of the Derby vault happens by [iterating](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L112-L126) over all protocols and withdrawing up to the full amount of deposited assets in each protocol until the total amount to be withdrawn is reached. As the total amount deposited in a protocol can be a significant portion of that underlying protocol's vault, it is entirely possible the default 0.01% loss is reached and the `withdraw()` called on Yearn vaults reverts. 
In this case the `rebalance()` call on the Derby vault also reverts making it impossible to rebalance the Derby vault.

## Impact
Rebalancing of a vault can fail and governance action could be needed to solve the situation.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding support for the `maxLoss` parameter on Yearn vaults.
Using Try/catch on the withdrawal Yearn vaults can also allow the rebalance to continue without the withdrawal from the Yearn vaults in order to reduce the impact of such cases.
