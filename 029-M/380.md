# Underflow during LP price diff calculation



## Summary
`priceDiff` is wrongly implemented so `Vault.storePriceAndRewards` will revert when the LP price goes down.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Vault.storePriceAndRewards`, `priceDiff` is used when we calculate `rewardPerLockedToken`.

The implementation is as follows:

```solidity
    int256 priceDiff = int256(currentPrice - lastPrices[_protocolId]);
```

The subtraction is called before conversion to `int256`. So it will revert when `currentPrice` < `lastPrice`.


## Impact

It will block `storePriceAndRewards` is called during `rebalance`, and `rebalance` is a very important functionality, so it has a high impact.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use Conversion before subtraction.

```solidity
    int256 priceDiff = int256(currentPrice) - int256(lastPrices[_protocolId]);
```
