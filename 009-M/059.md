# MainVault doesn't have ability to remove account from white list

## Summary
MainVault doesn't have ability to remove account from white list.
## Vulnerability Detail
MainVault has `whitelist`, which contains addresses that are [allowed to work with vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L111) when `training` mode.
There is ability for `onlyGuardian` to [`addToWhitelist`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L473), but there is no ability to remove someone from list.

Because of that it's not possible for protocol to remove address, if it's needed, in case if address was added by mistake or user somehow is banned.
## Impact
Whitelisted address can't be removed.

## Recommendation
Add function for removing address from whitelist.
