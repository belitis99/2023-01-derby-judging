# Already whitelisted address can not be removed

## Summary
Already whitelisted address can not be removed

## Vulnerability Detail
The `addToWhitelist` function only adds an address to the whitelist, and does not provide a way to remove addresses from it.

## Impact
This function sets the value of the whitelist mapping for a given address to true, effectively adding it to the list of addresses that are allowed to perform certain actions or access certain features within the smart contract. Once an address is added to the whitelist, it will remain on the list unless the code is modified to include a separate function that explicitly removes it.

If by mistake or just the guardian decide that already whitelisted address should not be whitelisted he can not remove him.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L472

```solidity
  function addToWhitelist(address _address) external onlyGuardian {
    whitelist[_address] = true;
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use more flexible function.
```solidity
function addToWhitelist(address _address, bool isWhitelisted) external onlyGuardian {
    whitelist[_address] = isWhitelisted;
  }
```
