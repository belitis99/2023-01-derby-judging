# blacklistProtocol() can revert because it executes on the to be blacklisted protocol itself and curve pool

## Summary

blacklistProtocol() can revert because it executes on the to be blacklisted protocol itself and curve pool

## Vulnerability Detail

`function blacklistProtocol(uint256 _protocolNum) external onlyGuardian {` calls `withdrawFromProtocol`. If the protocol is compromised, it is possible that their withdrawal functions will also be reverted.

Now, the blacklistProtocol will also revert.

While blacklisting, the protocol also makes a curve swap with predefined minOut parameters. This could also revert on turbulent market conditions (think UST, USDC depeg) where curve pool cannot satisfy the minOut.

## Impact

Protocol cannot be blacklisted. Rebalancing functions will continue to use the blacklisted protocol and possibly lose funds.

```solidity
function rebalanceCheckProtocols...
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      bool isBlacklisted = controller.getProtocolBlacklist(vaultNumber, i);
			...
      if (isBlacklisted) continue;
```

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function blacklistProtocol(uint256 _protocolNum) external onlyGuardian {
  uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(_protocolNum);
  currentAllocations[_protocolNum] = 0;
  controller.setProtocolBlacklist(vaultNumber, _protocolNum);
  savedTotalUnderlying -= balanceProtocol;
  withdrawFromProtocol(_protocolNum, balanceProtocol);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a try/catch in for `IProvider(protocol.provider).withdraw(` when calling from `blaclistProtocol` function function. If the withdraw fails, then the tx will still complete.
