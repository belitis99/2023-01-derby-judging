# `withdrawalRequest()` not checking 0 value, will result in breaking `withdrawalRequest()` and `withdrawalRequest()`

## Summary

`withdrawalRequest()` function from `MainVault.sol`, not checking `value` result, if the `value` is resulting in 0, user can't `withdrawAllowance()`, or enter `withdrawalRequest()` again.

## Vulnerability Detail

`withdrawalRequest()` function used to request a withdraw for the next rebalance period. If the requested `_amount` resulting in `value` that set `user.withdrawalAllowance` equal to 0, It still go trough and updating `user.withdrawalRequestPeriod` to the current `rebalancePeriod` value. 

But user can't call `withdrawAllowance()` since it require `user.withdrawalAllowance > 0` and also can't request new withdraw via `withdrawalRequest()` since `user.withdrawalRequestPeriod` is not 0. 

## Impact

User no longer can utilize `withdrawalRequest()` and `withdrawAllowance()`, which can limit withdrawing capability based only on current available funds on vault.

## PoC

PoC scenario : User accidently put 0 value on `withdrawalRequest()`, try to correct the `withdrawalRequest()` with correct value but failed because `user.withdrawalRequestPeriod` is not 0, also can't call `withdrawAllowance()` in the next rebalance period since `user.withdrawalAllowance` is 0.

```javascript
  it('withdrawalRequest and withdrawAllowance break PoC', async function () {
    const { vault, user } = await setupVault();
    await vault.connect(user).deposit(parseUSDC(10_000), user.address); // 10k
    expect(await vault.totalSupply()).to.be.equal(parseUSDC(10_000)); // 10k

    // mocking vault settings - setup non zero rebalancePeriod
    await vault.upRebalancingPeriodTEST();


    // accidently withdrawal request for 0 LP tokens 
    await expect(() =>
      vault.connect(user).withdrawalRequest(parseUSDC(0)),
    ).to.changeTokenBalance(vault, user, -parseUSDC(0));

    // // check withdrawalAllowance user and totalsupply
    expect(await vault.connect(user).getWithdrawalAllowance()).to.be.equal(parseUSDC(0));
    expect(await vault.totalSupply()).to.be.equal(parseUSDC(10_000));

    // try to withdrawRequest again to correcting request, but failed - caused by user.withdrawalRequestPeriod not 0
    await expect(vault.connect(user).withdrawalRequest(parseUSDC(10_000))).to.be.revertedWith("Already a request");

    // mocking vault settings - updating rebalance period
    await vault.upRebalancingPeriodTEST();

    // trying to withdraw allowance, but reverted because user.withdrawalAllowance is 0
    await expect(vault.connect(user).withdrawAllowance()).to.be.revertedWith('');

    // try to withdrawRequest again but already stuck - caused by user.withdrawalRequestPeriod not 0
    await expect(vault.connect(user).withdrawalRequest(parseUSDC(10_000))).to.be.revertedWith("Already a request");
  });
```

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L149-L162

in this function, 0 `value` will be processed and assigned to `user.withdrawalAllowance` and also update `user.withdrawalRequestPeriod`.
```solidity
  function withdrawalRequest(
    uint256 _amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");

    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);

    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
    totalWithdrawalRequests += value;
  }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L166-L179

In here, rejecting 0 value `user.withdrawalAllowance`.

```solidity
  function withdrawAllowance() external nonReentrant onlyWhenIdle returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalAllowance > 0, allowanceError);
    require(rebalancingPeriod > user.withdrawalRequestPeriod, "Funds not arrived");

    value = user.withdrawalAllowance;
    value = checkForBalance(value);

    reservedFunds -= value;
    delete user.withdrawalAllowance;
    delete user.withdrawalRequestPeriod;

    transferFunds(msg.sender, value);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider to add check the resulting `value` and revert if the value is 0 in `withdrawalRequest()`.

```solidity
  function withdrawalRequest(
    uint256 _amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");

    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());
    require(value > 0, "value is 0");

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);

    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
    totalWithdrawalRequests += value;
  }
```
