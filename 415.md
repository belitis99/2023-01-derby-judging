# Users will not able to get another redeemreward if they didnt withdraw

## Summary
Users will not able to get another redeemRewardsGame if they didn't withdraw  
## Vulnerability Detail

withdraw function deletes the  user.rewardAllowance value and makes it 0 every time if you have it the problem is if someone didn't want to withdraw will not able to redeemRewardsGame because of this require 

```solidity
    require(user.rewardAllowance == 0, allowanceError);

```
withdraw function 
```solidity
    delete user.rewardAllowance;

```
## Impact
f someone didn't want to withdraw will not able to redeemRewardsGame because of this require 
## Code Snippet
```solidity

function redeemRewardsGame(
    uint256 _value,
    address _user
  ) external onlyGame nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_user];
    require(user.rewardAllowance == 0, allowanceError);

    user.rewardAllowance = _value;
    user.rewardRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
    totalWithdrawalRequests += _value;
  }

  /// @notice Withdraw the reward allowance set by the game with redeemRewardsGame
  /// @dev Will swap vaultCurrency to Derby tokens, send the user funds and reset the allowance
  function withdrawRewards() external nonReentrant onlyWhenIdle returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.rewardAllowance > 0, allowanceError);
    require(rebalancingPeriod > user.rewardRequestPeriod, "!Funds");

    value = user.rewardAllowance;
    value = checkForBalance(value);

    reservedFunds -= value;
    delete user.rewardAllowance;
    delete user.rewardRequestPeriod;

    if (swapRewards) {
      uint256 tokensReceived = Swap.swapTokensMulti(
        Swap.SwapInOut(value, address(vaultCurrency), derbyToken),
        controller.getUniswapParams(),
        true
      );
      IERC20(derbyToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, tokensReceived);
    } else {
      vaultCurrency.safeTransfer(msg.sender, value);
    }
  }

## Recommendation
consider adding fixing this logic to the way user could redeemRewardsGame without withdrawing every time
