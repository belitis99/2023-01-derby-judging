# possibility of rounding errors in balanceUnderlying() found in CompoundProvider.sol

## Summary
rounding error
## Vulnerability Detail
There is a possibility of rounding errors in the calculation: (balanceShares * price) / 10 ** (10 + decimals).

## Impact
The division operation:  '(balanceShares * price) / 10 ** (10 + decimals)' may result in a fractional value that cannot be represented exactly in the given number of decimal places. This can cause a loss of precision in the calculation, leading to rounding errors.

For example, if balanceShares is 100 and price is 1.23, and decimals is 18 (the standard for Ethereum tokens), then the result of (balanceShares * price) would be 123. However, when this value is divided by 10 ** (10 + decimals), the result would be 0.000000000000123, which cannot be represented exactly in 18 decimal places.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
...maybe don't divide by 10 ** (10 + decimals).
