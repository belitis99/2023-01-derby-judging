# Possible loss of fund in YearnProvider

## Summary
There may be scenarios in Yearn where they don't have enough collateral to satisfy withdraw request and this will result in withdrawing less amount than requested amount i.e. partial withdraw.

## Vulnerability Detail
Yearn deploy its capital/collateral to other protocols and there may be scenarios when Yearn is not able to withdraw requested amount from other protocols collectively. In this scenario, Yearn will calculate `sharesToBurn` from partial amount it has withdrawn and burn partial shares. Given partial withdraw is possible in `withdraw()` of YearnProvider, current logic is not dealing with remaining LP token in `YearnProvider.sol`

## Impact
Unburnt/remaining shares (LP tokens) will remain in YearnProvider.sol contract and this amount will not be part of `balanceUnderlying()` hence will not be considered as amount under management. So it is clear to say that this scenario will results in loss of fund.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/YearnProvider.sol#L44-L66

```solidity
function withdraw(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _yToken,
    address _uToken
  ) external override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(msg.sender);

    require(
      IYearn(_yToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount) == true,
      "Error transferFrom"
    );

    uint256 uAmountReceived = IYearn(_yToken).withdraw(_amount);
    IERC20(_uToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, uAmountReceived);

    uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(msg.sender);
    require(
      (balanceAfter - balanceBefore - uAmountReceived) == 0,
      "Error Withdraw: under/overflow"
    );

    return uAmountReceived;
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Transfer remaining `_yTokens` to `msg.sender` after withdraw is done from Yearn
```solidity
    uint256 remainingLpBalance = IYearn(_yToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    if(remainingLpBalance != 0){
      IYearn(_yToken).transfer(msg.sender, remainingLpBalance)
    }
```
