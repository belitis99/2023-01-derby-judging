# XProvider.xSend do not fire event with connext message id, which is needed in order to work with tx

## Summary
XProvider.xSend do not fire event with connext message id, which is needed in order to work with tx
## Vulnerability Detail
XProvider.xSend sends tx using connext. `IConnext(connext).xcall` function returns id of the call. Using that id it's possible to make some actions related to the tx in the future.
But `XProvider` doesn't fetch that id and do not save it anyway.

As result, it can be a problem to find out id of a call in case of some problems.
Which problems can be? For example, relayerFee that was paid has changed, so noone wants to execute tx currently. So to run tx it's needed to increase relayerFee, by [calling `bumpTransfer` in connext contract](https://docs.connext.network/developers/guides/estimating-fees#bumping-relayer-fees). This function needs to know message id.

## Impact
It's problematic to find out your message id in case of any problems.
