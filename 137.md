# When a vault receives no allocations in 2 periods, all withdrawals are disabled.

## Summary
If the game players do not allocate anything to a vault on a chain two periods in a row, the vault (on that chain) gets (almost) automatically turned off, which prevents any withdrawals of deposits and rewards by vault depositors. There should be no such connection - even if a vault gets disabled this way, the depositors should be allowed to withdraw. 
## Vulnerability Detail
During the process of pushing allocations from the game this check is performed in the XChainController of whether the current allocations are zero and the incoming change is zero as well. If that is true, the vault on that chain is set to off inside the XController tracking.

This does not immediately propagate into the vault but it can be pushed by anyone externally in XChainController.

deposit, withdrawalRequest, withdraw and redeemRewardsGame is disabled.

Note that while allocations (i.e. invested money and balance) are 0, there can still be any amount in the funds reserved for withdrawal.
## Impact
Depositor funds and rewards can get locked in the vault and the state is not easy to recover from.

## Recommendation
Separate the "vault off" mechanic from disabling withdrawals.
