# State update is not handled properly during rebalance

## Summary
During rebalance process there may be scenarios which will results into inconsistent state.

## Vulnerability Detail
During the process of vault rebalance vault will withdraw amount from protocol if needed. 
Inside `pullFunds()` function vault is updating state `savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;` before calling `withdrawFromProtocol()` this will lead to inconsistency in 2 scenarios
- If protocol issue partial withdraw
- If collateral and protocol underlying are not same then vault will perform a swap which may result in less amount than requested.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L111-L127

Below is code of pullFunds() which is updating state before withdraw
```solidity
  function pullFunds(uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;

      uint256 shortage = _value - vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this));
      uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(i);

      uint256 amountToWithdraw = shortage > balanceProtocol ? balanceProtocol : shortage;
      savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;

      if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) break;
      withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw);

      if (_value <= vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this))) break;
    }
  }
```

## Impact
Wrongly saved `savedTotalUnderlying` has impact at various places but not just limited to
- `storePriceAndRewards` is calculated wrong.
-  `amountToProtocol` is calculated wrong for each protocol in allocated proportion. Protocol may have higher actual underlying balance than calculated `amountToProtocol`. This result in wrong `amountToDeposit` and `amountToWithdraw`

Overall there are multiple ripple effect in the contract due to wrong state of `savedTotalUnderlying`. 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider returning actual amount withdrawn from protocol and use it to subtract from savedTotalUnderlying
```solidity
      uint256 actualAmountWithdrawn = withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw);
      savedTotalUnderlying -= actualAmountWithdrawn;
```
