# less rewards to players since rewards are calculated according to the last rebalancing period and not from the time of deposit.

## Summary
AS stated from the docs users should generate yield from the moment of depositing funds.https://derby-finance.gitbook.io/derby-finance-docs/products/vaults/user-interactions/deposit.
this is not the case since rewards are calculated after a relancing period.

## Vulnerability Detail
_getRewardsPerLockedToken_  calculates rewards based on a rebalancing period meaning rewards are only calculated after a rebalancing period has elapsed and not from the time of deposit. 

## Impact
users will not receive their true rewards.
