# onlyVault modifier allows for unauthorized access to restricted functions.

## Summary
`onlyVault()` modifier in the Controller does not prevent malicious actors from adding themselves to the whitelist, enabling them to bypass access control mechanisms.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
require(vaultWhitelist[msg.sender] == true, "Controller: only Vault");
```

This modifier restricts access to certain functions only to those addresses that are present in the `vaultWhitelist` mapping. However, this mapping is publicly accessible and can be modified by anyone, there is no proper mechanism in place to prevent malicious actors from adding themselves to the whitelist, which could allow them to bypass the access control mechanism. Therefore, any function that uses the `onlyVault` modifier could be vulnerable to unauthorized access.

This can be exploited by a malicious actor who can add themselves to the whitelist and then call the functions that are restricted to vaults. For example, the `claim()` function can be called by anyone who is whitelisted in the `vaultWhitelist` mapping, which would allow them to harvest tokens from underlying protocols.

## Impact
The vulnerability could allow an attacker to add themselves to the vault whitelist, permitting them to access restricted functions without the necessary permissions, and this can result in the attacker being able to take control of the vault and steal funds or cause other malicious activities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement an access control mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties can add themselves to the whitelist. This could include a multi-factor authentication process, as well as additional verification steps.
