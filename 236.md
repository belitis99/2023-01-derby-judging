# User cannot withdraw their allowance when the vault's balance is exceeds the divergence limit.

## Summary
When a user has issued a withdrawal request in the previous period and the difference between the requested amount and the balance of the vault exceeds the maximum divergence limit the withdrawal will revert and the user will not be able to withdraw their funds until the next period.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `withDrawAllowance()` function checks the actual balance of the vault against the user's allowance. 
```solidity
  function withdrawAllowance() external nonReentrant onlyWhenIdle returns (uint256 value) {
    ...
    value = user.withdrawalAllowance;
    value = checkForBalance(value);
	...
    transferFunds(msg.sender, value);
  }
```

The  `checkForBalance()` reduces the amount to withdraw to the balance of the vault, but requires  the difference not to exceed a set limit (1 USDC). If it does the call reverts and the user will be unable to withdraw their allowance and will have to wait until the next period, which could be up to 2 weeks.

## Impact
User could be unable to withdraw their allowance for up to 2 weeks, which could have a big impact on the user (e.g. liquidations etc.).

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider allowing the user to withdraw their allowance partially.
