## Summary
As we've seen recently any of the used stable coins can become significantly depegged. 
Throughout the code base several calculations for converting amounts between the underlying assets of the Derby vault and the protocol pools assume the exchange rate to be 1.  
This can lead to unexpected results.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `balanceUnderlying()` function calls the `Provider` contract's `balanceUnderlying()` function and converts the provider's underlying amount to it's own underlying token amount by only using the scales of both assets in the calculation:
```solidity
    uint256 underlyingBalance = (IProvider(protocol.provider).balanceUnderlying(
      address(this),
      protocol.LPToken
    ) * uScale) / protocol.uScale;
```
This is an implicit exchange rate of 1.

The `calcShares()` uses the same implicit exchange rate of 1 for calculating the shares.
```solidity
  function calcShares(uint256 _protocolNum, uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256) {
    IController.ProtocolInfoS memory protocol = controller.getProtocolInfo(
      vaultNumber,
      _protocolNum
    );
    uint256 shares = IProvider(protocol.provider).calcShares(
      (_amount * protocol.uScale) / uScale,
      protocol.LPToken
    );
```
Here the amount specified in the provider's `calcShare()` function is scaled without exchange rate between the Derby vault's `vaultCurrency` and the protocol's underlying asset.
These wrongly calculated amounts are then used during depositing in and withdrawing from the underlying protocols.

Additionally the [`depositInProtocol()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L292-L296) and [`withdrawFromProtocol()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L314-L334) both use the `Swap` library's `swapStableCoins()`call, which scales and deducts the Curve pool's fee to calculate the minimum required amount received from swapping the provider's underlying to the vaultCurrency. 
```solidity
    uint256 amountOutMin = (((_swap.amount * (10000 - _curve.poolFee)) / 10000) * _tokenOutUScale) /
      _tokenInUScale;
    IERC20(_swap.tokenIn).safeIncreaseAllowance(_curve.pool, _swap.amount);


    uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_swap.tokenOut).balanceOf(address(this));


    IStableSwap3Pool(_curve.pool).exchange(
      _curve.indexTokenIn,
      _curve.indexTokenOut,
      _swap.amount,
      amountOutMin
    );
```
This means the swap can fail when there is unforeseen slippage in the 3pool which can be significate in extreme cases as we've seen recently (10%). As these are used during a rebalance of the vault the result is that the rebalance itself reverts.
If the protocol's underlying is worth less than the vaultCurrency the calculated amount to withdraw is less than the actual amount in the underlying protocol possibly resulting in a certain amount left behind in the protocol (in case of a blacklist) or not enough underlying being withdrawn from the protocol during a rebalance.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using Curve's `get_dy()` to determine the exchange rate in the 3pool as documented [here](https://curve.readthedocs.io/exchange-pools.html#making-exchanges). Then use that exchange rate to determine the correct amount of protocol underlying to deposit,  withdraw, and exchange in the 3pool.
