# Make withdrawal request before vault become inactive could hold user funds

## Summary

User can make request withdrawal via `withdrawalRequest()`  right before vault become inactive in the next rebalance cycle. Causing vault not receiving reserved funds for withdraw and user can't call `withdrawAllowance()`, until the vault active again.

## Vulnerability Detail

Call `withdrawalRequest()` right before vault become inactive in the next rebalance cycle will burn user's vault token and assign value to `user.withdrawalAllowance` and vault's `totalWithdrawalRequests` so user can withdraw in the next rebalance. But system rebalance  process (once per two weeks) will happened without involving this inactive vault. User can't call `withdrawAllowance()` which should be work while vault idle even the vault is inactive. 

Example scenario :
1. rebalance happened with the vault allocations total become 0,
2. User call `withdrawalRequest()`  in this vault
3. rebalance happened with the vault delta 0 while allocations total also 0, trigger vault to inactive.
4. User can't call `withdrawAllowance()` in this cycle.


## Impact

Causing user need to wait next rebalance cycle or even more (at least two more weeks), with hope the Game player assign allocations to this vault, or have to assign allocations himself.

While vault is inactive, `pushVaultAmounts()` and `sendFundsToVault()` will not sending withdrawal requests to the vault.
```solidity
  function pushVaultAmounts(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint16 _chain
  ) external payable onlyWhenUnderlyingsReceived(_vaultNumber) {
    address vault = getVaultAddress(_vaultNumber, _chain);
    require(vault != address(0), "xChainController: not a valid vaultnumber");
    int256 totalAllocation = getCurrentTotalAllocation(_vaultNumber);
    uint256 totalWithdrawalRequests = getTotalWithdrawalRequests(_vaultNumber);
    uint256 totalUnderlying = getTotalUnderlyingVault(_vaultNumber) - totalWithdrawalRequests;
    uint256 totalSupply = getTotalSupply(_vaultNumber);

    uint256 decimals = xProvider.getDecimals(vault);
    uint256 newExchangeRate = (totalUnderlying * (10 ** decimals)) / totalSupply;

    if (!getVaultChainIdOff(_vaultNumber, _chain)) {
      int256 amountToChain = calcAmountToChain(
        _vaultNumber,
        _chain,
        totalUnderlying,
        totalAllocation
      );
      (int256 amountToDeposit, uint256 amountToWithdraw) = calcDepositWithdraw(
        _vaultNumber,
        _chain,
        amountToChain
      );

      sendXChainAmount(_vaultNumber, _chain, amountToDeposit, amountToWithdraw, newExchangeRate);
    }
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider add additional check if `totalWithdrawalRequests` is not 0, keep process the vault and not yet consider it inactive.
