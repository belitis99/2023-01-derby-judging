# Gamers and depositors lose rewards in Idle and Beta protocols

## Summary
Idle and Beta protocols distribute rewards (in IDLE + COMP and BETA tokens, respectively) to depositors of their vaults. However, while Derby integrates with Idle and Beta, it doesn't claim rewards from these protocols. As a result, gamers and depositors will lose rewards if gamers decide to allocate funds to Idle or Beta vaults.
## Vulnerability Detail
The Derby protocol integrates with third-party protocol to generate yield on user-deposited funds. Among these protocols are Idle and Base. These two protocols issue additional rewards to their users:
1. Idle [rewards depositors of the USDC vault with IDLE and COMP tokens](https://app.idle.finance/#/earn/best-yield/0x5274891bec421b39d23760c04a6755ecb444797c);
1. Beta [rewards depositors of its USDC vault with BETA tokens](https://app.betafinance.org/).

However, the respective providers ([IdleProvider](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/IdleProvider.sol#L11) and [BetaProvider](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/BetaProvider.sol#L10)) don't allow to claim those rewards: the `claim` function in both providers is not implemented.

Reward tokens are claimed during rebalancing: the [Vault.rebalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L135) function [claims reward tokens in protocols that reward them](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L141). Claimed reward tokens are then [swapped for the underlying token of the vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L412-L416), which increases the [balance of the vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L144), which eventually [increases the exchange rate of vault LP tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L307) and [gamer rewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L233-L236). 
## Impact
Gamers and depositors may lose a big portion of rewards (reward tokens are usually used to increase APY and attract liquidity) if deposit funds to Idle or Beta protocols.
## Code Snippet
1. `IdleProvider.claim` is not implemented:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/IdleProvider.sol#L120
1. `BetaProvider.claim` is also not implemented:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/BetaProvider.sol#L122
1. However, both Idle and Beta reward depositors of the USDC vaults with reward tokens.
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider implementing the `IdleProvider.claim` function and the `BetaProvider.claim` so that reward tokens could be claimed from Idle and Beta vaults during rebalancing and distributed to gamers and depositors.
