# Unchecked returned value - Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom instead of transfer/transferFrom

## Summary
Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead, return false (e.g. [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code)).

## Impact
in the xTransfer function at XProvider.sol#L147, we used transferFrom to transfer tokens from the user to the contract the return value is not checked. If the token send fails, it will cause a lot of serious problems.

another problem related to using transferFrom is in the unchecked returned value from calling to the XProvider.sol#L115. in this line we make the call to another chain to transfer the ERC20 token to the target address.

 **XProvider.sol#L115:**
_IConnext(connext).xcall{value: relayerFee}(
      _destinationDomain, // _destination: Domain ID of the destination chain
      target, // _to: address of the target contract
      address(0), // _asset: use address zero for 0-value transfers
      msg.sender, // _delegate: address that can revert or forceLocal on destination
      0, // _amount: 0 because no funds are being transferred
      0, // _slippage: can be anything between 0-10000 because no funds are being transferred
      _callData // _callData: the encoded calldata to send
    );_

**and in the ConnextMock.sol#L22 :**
    _if (_asset != address(0)) IERC20(_asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, _to, _amount);
    else
      IXReceiver(_to).xReceive(
        bytes32(""),
        0,
        address(0),
        msg.sender,
        domainLookup[msg.sender],
        _callData
      );_

function at ConnextMock.sol#L22, will return bytes32 as the answer to the call but, in the  XProvider.sol#L115 we don't check returned value.

**I used the ConnextMock contract because I couldn't find the Connext contract.**
