# The `Guardian` won't be able to set the `Yearn` protocol to the blacklist

## Summary
From [Yearn Docs](https://docs.yearn.finance/getting-started/products/yvaults/vault-tokens)
```diff
For example, if you deposit YFI in a yVault you will receive yvYFI in return. yvYFI would be the yVault Token.

If your yVault generates profit, the share price of your yVault tokens will increase. 
This happens because there are more underlying tokens in the yVault to redeem upon withdrawal.
```

So the `balanceUnderlying()` with **Yearn** protocol could keep returning increased amounts over time

## Vulnerability Detail
in case you have only one protocol **Yearn** on this vault. which will need to be blacklisted over time 
[blacklistProtocol()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L477-L483) will revert because  `balanceProtocol > savedTotalUnderlying`

## Impact
The **Guardian** won't be able to set the **Yearn** protocol (or any other with the same idea) to the blacklist

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function blacklistProtocol(uint256 _protocolNum) external onlyGuardian {
    uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(_protocolNum);
    currentAllocations[_protocolNum] = 0;
    controller.setProtocolBlacklist(vaultNumber, _protocolNum);
    savedTotalUnderlying -= balanceProtocol;
    withdrawFromProtocol(_protocolNum, balanceProtocol);
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You should just set `savedTotalUnderlying` to zero
