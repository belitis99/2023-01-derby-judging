# MainVault.deposit() fails to enforce the deposit maxium for white-listed depositors in training

## Summary
MainVault.deposit() fails to enforce the deposit maxium for white-listed depositors in training. As a result, they can actually deposit as much as they want. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The ``deposit()`` function allows a user to deposit vault currency and mint vault tokens. 
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L106-L124](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L106-L124)

However, the following code fails to enforce the deposit maximum limit: 
```javascript

if (training) {
      require(whitelist[msg.sender]);
      uint256 balanceSender = (balanceOf(msg.sender) * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());
      require(_amount + balanceSender <= maxTrainingDeposit);
    }
```
It fails because: 1) the user will actually receive the shares in the ``_receiver`` address, not the ``msg.sender`` address. Therefore, a user can deposit as much as he wants since the shares will be saved in a different address; 2) Even we check the balance of ``receiver`` as well, the user can still use a different "receiver`` each time to bypass this check. 3) The user can always transfer the shares to different accounts. 

The correct way to enforce this is to keep track of how much total shares have been minted by ``msg.sender`` regardless where those shares are stored currently. 





## Impact
MainVault.deposit() fails to enforce the deposit maxium for white-listed depositors in training. As a result, they can actually deposit as much as they want.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a mapping variable ``trainingBalanceOf`` to keep track of the shares minted by ``msg.sender`` during training. 
```diff
 function deposit(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 shares) {
    if (training) {
      require(whitelist[msg.sender]);
-      uint256 balanceSender = (balanceOf(msg.sender) * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());
+     uint256 balanceSender = (trainingBalanceOf(msg.sender) * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());
      require(_amount + balanceSender <= maxTrainingDeposit);
    }

    uint256 balanceBefore = getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;
    vaultCurrency.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    uint256 balanceAfter = getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;

    uint256 amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
    shares = (amount * (10 ** decimals())) / exchangeRate;

+ if(training) trainingBalanceOf[msg.sender] += shares;
    _mint(_receiver, shares);
  }
```
