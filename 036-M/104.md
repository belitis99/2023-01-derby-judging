# maxTrainingDeposit can be trivially circumvented

## Summary
At launch a `training` flag is set to limit the amount a user can deposit combined with a whitelist. This amount can however trivially be circumvented when the user send the corresponding Vault tokens to another address before depositing more funds into the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the training flag is enabled an extra check is done when depositing into the vault.
```solidity
  function deposit(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 shares) {
    if (training) {
      require(whitelist[msg.sender]);
      uint256 balanceSender = (balanceOf(msg.sender) * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());
      require(_amount + balanceSender <= maxTrainingDeposit);
    }
    ...
}
```
The check is based on the (whitelisted) user's balance. This can be trivially circumvented by temporarily transferring the vault tokens to another address. This way the `balanceOf(msg.sender)` will be 0 and the user can deposit op to the `maxTrainingDeposit` again. This can be repeated without limit.

## Impact
The `maxTrainingDeposit` is ineffective as this bypasses the intended limit per user at launch.

## Recommendation
Store the already deposited amount in storage based on the user's address when the training flag is enabled and perform the check against the storage variable.
