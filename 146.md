# one buyer receives all the shares if two or more buyers are depositing to the vault at the same time.

## Summary
The balance of the vault is used to determine the amount of shares to be minted by a buyer after they have transferred funds to the vault . in case where several buyers have transferred funds to the vault at the same time one buyer receives all the shares.
## Vulnerability Detail
when depositing funds to the vault , the function deposit first checks the balance of the vault before funds are transferred to the vault then transfers amount to the vault thereafter check the balance again. the difference in the balance of vault before and after equals to the amount that is used to get the shares to be minted by the buyer. when two or more buyers are depositing to the vault at the same time one buyer will receive all the shares since the whole balance of the vault is used to calculate the amount to convert to shares which is minted by the buyer.


## Impact
Other depositors will not be able to mint their share of LP tokens while one buyer mints all the shares.


## Code Snippet
function deposit(
uint256 _amount,
address _receiver
) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 shares) {
if (training) {
require(whitelist[msg.sender]);
uint256 balanceSender = (balanceOf(msg.sender) * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());
require(_amount + balanceSender <= maxTrainingDeposit);
}

uint256 balanceBefore = getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;
vaultCurrency.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
uint256 balanceAfter = getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;

uint256 amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
shares = (amount * (10 ** decimals())) / exchangeRate;

_mint(_receiver, shares);
