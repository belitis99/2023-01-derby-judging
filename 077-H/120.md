# Rewards per locked token are calculated incorrectly

## Summary
Rewards per locked token are calculated incorrectly as they are calculated, when at the allocation time, but should be calculated at the end of rebalancing period.
## Vulnerability Detail
The purpose of Game is to allow user to make allocations into different providers. Depending on the price of providers LP and staked amount of derby token, player receive rewards for the rebalancing period.
So actually user should allocate amount, then rebalancing period is started and according to the allocations of players different providers are funded. Then at the end of rebalance period, rewards should be calculated that players were able to earn by their allocations.

The problem is that protocol currently implements this in different way. Rewards are calculated, once vault received new allocations. So actually this allocations even didn't have time to work in order to calculate earning.

So once allocations are [received from the game](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L137) and XController [provided needed underlying](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L136), then `Vault.rebalance` is called.
This function will also call `rebalanceCheckProtocols`, which then calls [`storePriceAndRewards` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L186). This function is responsible for calculating rewards per locked token for provider.

And as you can see it is called too early, as allocations and underlying for them just arrived and they are not even deposited yet into providers. So you shouldn't calculate earnings for that allocations yet, you need to wait till end of rebalance period.

End of rebalance period is when `MainVault.sendRewardsToGame` is called. So i believe, rewards should be calculated exactly at this function.

## Recommendation
Calculate rewards inside `MainVault.sendRewardsToGame` function.
