# User can block himself from future withdrawalRequest creating

## Summary
User can block himself from future withdrawalRequest creating in case if he create request to withdraw 0 shares.
## Vulnerability Detail
`MainVault.withdrawalRequest` allows user to create request to withdraw funds after next rebalance.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L149-L162
```solidity
  function withdrawalRequest(
    uint256 _amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");


    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());


    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);


    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
    totalWithdrawalRequests += value;
  }
```
As you can see if `user.withdrawalRequestPeriod != 0`, then he is not allowed to create new request. In other words, once you have not withdrawn request, you can't create new one.
Pls, note that you can create request for 0 amount of shares. Then `user.withdrawalAllowance` will be set to 0.

Once user does that, then he will not be able to call `withdrawAllowance` as it [doesn't allow `withdrawalAllowance` to be 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L168).
That means that function will [never delete `user.withdrawalRequestPeriod`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L176), and user will not be able to create new request in future.
## Impact
Block of withdraw request functionality for user.

## Recommendation
Do not allow to create request when `user.withdrawalAllowance` is 0.
