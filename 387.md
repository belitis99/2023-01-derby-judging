# Incorrect slippage calculation in Swap.swapStableCoins

## Summary

The code assumes that all stablecoins in curve pools are interchangeable for one another in a 1:1 ratio (minus pool fee).

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently the amountOutMin is calculated only taking into account the input amount and the scale of the two tokens (+ the fee):

```solidity
    uint256 amountOutMin = (((_swap.amount * (10000 - _curve.poolFee)) / 10000) * _tokenOutUScale) /
      _tokenInUScale;
```

This is a problem as depending on the swapped tokens and the corresponding reserves in the curve pool, it would pretty likely (50% of the time) return lower amount then amountOutMin. This will cause the depositInProtocol and withdrawFromProtocol to revert unexpectedly.

This is also true for Swap.swapTokensMulti.

## Impact

Stablecoin swaps can revert in Vault.depositInProtocol and Vault.withdrawFromProtocol causing a temporary DoS for the users.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    uint256 amountOutMin = (((_swap.amount * (10000 - _curve.poolFee)) / 10000) * _tokenOutUScale) /
      _tokenInUScale;
```

## Recommendation

Calculate slippage off-chain or reduce it.
