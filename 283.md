# No way to change `beneficiary`

## Summary

The contract should have a way to change the `beneficiary` address.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `TokenTimelock.sol` contract, all locked tokens will be transferred to the beneficiary address. However, due to several reasons, the beneficiary may want to change address. There is no way to do it.

## Impact

It can lead to the loss of locked funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Adding two-step `beneficiary` transfer.

```solidity
address private pendingBeneficiary;

function transferBeneficiary(address newBeneficiary) public onlyBeneficiary {
	pendingBeneficiary = newBeneficiary;
}

function confirmBeneficiaryTransfer() public {
	require(pendingBeneficiary == msg.sender, "Caller is not the pending beneficiary");
	beneficiary = pendingBeneficiary;
}
```
