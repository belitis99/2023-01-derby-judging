# Bypass the withdraw request restriction.

## Summary
Users can transfer shares to other accounts to bypass the withdraw request restriction.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ```withdrawalRequest()``` is used to withdrawal request for when the vault doesnt have enough funds available.The protocol does not allow users to submit next withdrawal requests until the current withdrawal request has been processed.
```solidity
 require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");
```
Actually users can transfer shares to other accounts to bypass this restriction.

```solidity
  function withdraw(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver,
    address _owner
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    require(value > 0, "!value");

    require(getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds >= value, "!funds");

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    transferFunds(_receiver, value);
  }

```

## Impact
Users can transfer shares to other accounts to bypass the withdraw request restriction.
