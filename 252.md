# Unsafe `approve()` function resulting in failed transfer for certain ERC20 token (USDT)

## Summary

Unsafe `approve()` function resulting in failed transfer for certain ERC20 token (USDT)

## Vulnerability Detail

From `README`, we know that Derby will support USDT. This USDT is well-known for classic non-standard ERC20 token which has issue related to `approve()` function.

`xTransfer` function in `XProvider.sol` calls approve that do not handle non-standard ERC20 behaviour. 
1. Some token contracts do not return any value.
2. Some token contracts revert the transaction when the allowance is not zero.

The current implementation in `xTransfer` function uses a simple approve function, instead of the safer `safeApprove`. Also it's recommended to have an approve to zero first, since the allowance could be already positive and some tokens (e.g. USDT) wouldn't work in this case.

## Impact

Failed to approve the token, will resulting in failed transfer of the token, which is not expected by the protocol.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L149-L150

```solidity
File: XProvider.sol
133:   function xTransfer(
134:     address _token,
135:     uint256 _amount,
136:     address _recipient,
137:     uint32 _destinationDomain,
138:     uint256 _slippage,
139:     uint256 _relayerFee
140:   ) internal {
...
149:     // This contract approves transfer to Connext
150:     IERC20(_token).approve(address(connext), _amount);
151: 
...
161:   }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend to use safeApprove instead and set the allowance to 0 before calling it.
```solidity
IERC20(_token).safeApprove(address(connext), 0);
IERC20(_token).safeApprove(address(connext), _amount);
```
