# Vault.storePriceAndRewards supposes that all stable coins have same price

## Summary
Vault.storePriceAndRewards supposes that all stable coins have same price. As result rewards per provider are calculated incorrectly.
## Vulnerability Detail
Player of the `Game` earns rewards that are nominated in `vaultCurrency` token. Function `Vault.storePriceAndRewards` is responsible for fetching [exchange price of provider](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L227) and then calculate rewards per locked derby token that depends on previous price and performance fee.

When new rewards are set to the Game, then they are all [added together](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L526-L528). This means that Game contract supposes that rewards are provided in `vaultCurrency` token.

But the problem is that `Vault.price` function returns price in provider's underlying token, which can be not same as `vaultCurrency` token.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L384-L390
```solidity
  function price(uint256 _protocolNum) public view returns (uint256) {
    IController.ProtocolInfoS memory protocol = controller.getProtocolInfo(
      vaultNumber,
      _protocolNum
    );
    return IProvider(protocol.provider).exchangeRate(protocol.LPToken);
  }
```

That means that each provider can provide price in another underlying token.
There are 2 problems here:
1.Prices of different stable tokens are not same. So the price should be converted to the `vaultCurrency` price before storing rewards.
2.Different stable tokens have different decimals count. So this can actually mess up all calculations. For example DAI is 18 decimals, while USDC is 6 decimals. In case if `vaultCurrency` is USDC, then rewards from DAI providers will overvalued.

Because of this 2 reasons i guess it's high severity issue.
## Impact
Rewards are calculated incorrectly.

## Recommendation
You need to convert price to `vaultCurrency` tokens in case if provider's underlying token is not `vaultCurrency` token.
