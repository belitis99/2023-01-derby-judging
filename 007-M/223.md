# Allowance is not set to zero first before approving

## Summary
when using `xTransfer` to transfer fund from a chain to the other, if USDT token is being sent and the approval tries to change from a non-zero allowance, the approval will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens like USDT do not allow approve to be called on a non-zero allowance. 

```solidity
    IERC20(_token).approve(address(connext), _amount);
```

## Impact
`xTransfer` will fail if approve does not work.
