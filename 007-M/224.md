# Unsafe use of ERC20 approve

---
name: 'unsafe ERC20 approve'
about: 'Reset approval before setting approval'
title: 'Use of unsafe ERC20 approve without reset to zero'
labels: 'Medium'

---

## Summary
It is recommended to reduce the spender allowance to zero before each approve(<SPENDER>, <AMOUNT>) call.

## Vulnerability Detail
IERC20.approve() function is called without setting the allowance to zero. Some tokens, like USDT, require first reducing the address' allowance to zero by calling approve(_spender, 0).

## Impact
Some tokens, like USDT, require first reducing the address' allowance to zero by calling approve(_spender, 0). Transactions will revert when using an unsupported token like USDT
