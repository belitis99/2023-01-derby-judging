# Chainid logic is Unvarying!

## Summary
because Chainid cannot change, if a chain id of a chain changes one day it can be dangerous because of issues like replay attack  
## Vulnerability Detail
the chain id logic is implemented so there are no options for changing it or getting it external. 
## Impact
if the chain id doesn't update it can cause replay attacks in chain forks when the chain id of chain is changed. 
## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L59


```solidity

// array of chainIds e.g [10, 100, 1000];
  uint32[] public chainIds;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
look at the open zeppelin explanation about updating chain id to prevent replay attacks during chain id changes
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/drafts#EIP712-_domainSeparatorV4-- 
The encoding specified in the EIP is very generic, and such a generic implementation in Solidity is not feasible, thus this contract does not implement the encoding itself. 

```solidity
//Returns the domain separator for the current chain.

_domainSeparatorV4()
```
