# `addDeltaAllocationChain()` function allows for negative input parameter.

## Summary
The contract lacks input validation in the `addDeltaAllocationChain()` function. The `_deltaAllocation` input is not checked whether it is negative or positive, making it susceptible to unintended consequences.

## Vulnerability Detail
    vaults[_vaultNumber].deltaAllocationChain[_chainId] += _deltaAllocation;

The vulnerability in the contract is that the `addDeltaAllocationChain()` function does not validate the input parameter `_deltaAllocation` to check whether it is negative or positive. This can lead to unintended consequences in the code execution.

The addDeltaAllocationChain() function is a setter function that sets the delta allocation of a particular chain ID in a specific vault. It takes three input parameters: `_vaultNumber (the number of the vault), _chainId (the number of the chain ID)`, and `_deltaAllocation` (the delta allocation to set).

The vulnerability arises from the fact that `_deltaAllocation` can be any integer, positive or negative, and the function does not check for this. This means that an attacker could call this function and set a negative `_deltaAllocation` value, which would subtract from the current delta allocation of the specified chain ID in the given vault. This could lead to a situation where the total allocation of the vault for that chain ID becomes negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the contract.

For instance, if an attacker sets a negative `_deltaAllocation` value, and the current delta allocation for the chain ID in the vault is already low, the total allocation for the chain ID could become negative. If this happens, the contract may interpret this negative allocation as an overflow, which could result in unexpected and potentially harmful behavior.

## Impact
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a negative `_deltaAllocation` input to the `addDeltaAllocationChain()` function, leading to the following unexpected consequences:

* The value of the `deltaAllocationChain` mapping for a specific `vaultNumber and chainId` will decrease by the amount of the negative `_deltaAllocation`.

* This could cause the allocation of tokens for that particular `vaultNumber and chainId` to become negative. Such negative allocations could lead to unexpected behavior in the contract and result in a loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add input validation in the `addDeltaAllocationChain()` function to ensure that the `_deltaAllocation` input is positive. The following changes should be made to the function:
```solidity
function addDeltaAllocationChain(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint256 _chainId,
    int256 _deltaAllocation
) internal {
+   require(_deltaAllocation > 0, "Delta allocation should be positive.");
    vaults[_vaultNumber].deltaAllocationChain[_chainId] += _deltaAllocation;
}
```
The above code will ensure that the `_deltaAllocation` input is positive and the allocation mapping is updated accordingly.
