# Malicious user can trigger XProvider calls with small or 0 relayerFee in order to make txs stuck waiting while someone will execute them

## Summary
Malicious user can trigger XProvider calls with small or 0 relayerFee in order to make txs stuck waiting while someone will execute them.
## Vulnerability Detail
`XProvider.xSend` creates and sends message [through the connext](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L110-L124). It has `_relayerFee` param which will be send as payment to relayers for executing that tx.
`XProvider.xSend` is called by different functions of `XProvider`.

Let's just check one of them in order to see, how it can be used by attacker.
`XProvider.pushAllocations` function [sends information](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L196) about allocations to xController. 
It's is triggered by [`Game.pushAllocationsToController` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L439). And this function can be called by anyone. 
Actually, any function that calls XProvider's functions can be called by anyone.
Because of that malicious user can send msg.value as 0 for such call(or very small amount in case if connext revert on 0 fee) in order to pay such relayerFee that relayers will never execute that tx.
Because of that, protocol will need to fix that issue by increasing fee for that connext transaction.

## Impact
Connext tx can be created with small fee, so they will be stuck for a long time

## Recommendation
I guess you need to restrict users that can initiate XProvider calls.
