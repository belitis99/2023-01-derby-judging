# unauthorized withdrawals due to LACK of proper access control implementation

## Summary
There is no access control implemented in the withdraw function of MainVault.sol.

## Vulnerability Detail
Access control isn't implemented in the withdraw function in MainVault.sol, therefore MainVault.sol is susceptible to unauthorized withdrawals.

## Impact

**Unauthorized users can input their addresses as '_receiver' and withdraw from the vault as there is no check to validate their authorization in the withdraw function:**


In the function withdraw(), there are two checks to make sure that 0 isn't inputed as value and also to calc the balance of the vault and deduct reservedFunds from it and make sure that the inputted '_value' is greater or equals the outcome of the calculation which is good, as this helps to check and make sure there are funds in the vault.

Now, **the problem here now is that the withdraw() function is accessible to everyone** and it uses transferFunds() to send funds to the receiver.

transferFunds() calculates the gov fee by multiplying '_value' against governanceFee and then dividing the outcome  against  '10_000' and storing it to the variable 'govFee'
After that, a transfer is made from vaultCurrency to 'getDao()' with 'govFee' and also a second transfer is done to the '_receiver' with _value deducting the govFee sent to 'getDao()'

### The issue here is that the transfer to the 'receiver' is made from 'vaultCurrency' and there is no check to make sure that the '_receiver' is an **authorized user** having access to **his** funds through the withdraw function.
I think authorised users should be given id's 

Unauthorized users can input their addresses as '_receiver' and withdraw from the vault as there is no check to validate their authorization in the withdraw function. 

_it is also good to note that the param "_owner" was never used in the logic of withdraw function, i think it should be removed._

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
put a check to make sure only authorized users can call this function. I suggest giving authorized users id's and putting a check to confirm their id's.
