# Dos attack to function PushAllocationsToVault since it sends over an array where the index is the protocolId

## Summary
if there are too many protocol allocations to push to the vault it can cause the transaction to revert since block gas limit will be reached.

## Vulnerability Detail
existence of many protocols with delta allocations to be pushed can make the transaction to fail since it will cost much gas and the block gas limit will be attained.


## Impact

The function pushallocationstovault will fail to function which can alter other functions of the system.
