# Flash loan attack to claimTokens.

## Summary
An attacker can use flash loan attack to claimTokens and make a profit.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ```claimTokens()``` is used to harvest extra tokens from underlying protocols. It can be callable by anyone. In the function ,the protocol will swap the govToken to vaultCurrency. ```currentAllocations[i]``` is not reset.  Let's show how an attacker make a profit.
1. Bob uses a flash loan to borrow a large amount of govToken from third-party market and swap them to vaultCurrency.This purchase raises the price of vaultCurrency  for the Mainvault and increases the slippage ( Expected price increase or decrease in price based on the volume to be traded and the available liquidity).
2. Bob calls ```claimTokens()``` to harvest extra tokens from underlying protocols and swap the govToken to vaultCurrency . Because of this high purchase of vaultCurrency  , its price goes up, and the Mainvault buys at a higher price of vaultCurrency.
3. Bob sells at a higer price and make a profit.
```solidity
function claimTokens() public {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;
      bool claim = controller.claim(vaultNumber, i);
      if (claim) {
        address govToken = controller.getGovToken(vaultNumber, i);
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20(govToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        Swap.swapTokensMulti(
          Swap.SwapInOut(tokenBalance, govToken, address(vaultCurrency)),
          controller.getUniswapParams(),
          false
        );
      }
    }
  }
```

## Impact
The protocol will lose funds.
