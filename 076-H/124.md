# incorrect value of getvaultbalance after tokenstoburn are transferred from the game contract.https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby-htstarz/blob/d8087be46dd1846698e01b15b2fac534e4d7f99c/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol

## Summary
the function _redeemnegativerewards_  calculates if there are any negative rewards and the amount of tokens to burn and then transfers them to the _homevault_  where they are to be burned. the _homevault_ however does not burn this tokens since there isn't  any function to burn these tokens making the value of getvaultbalance to be incorrect afterwards.

## Vulnerability Detail
 when there are negative rewards , _tokenstoburn_ are calculated and then transferred to the _homevault_ making the balance of the _homevault_ to increase and since a function to burn these tokens is missing , the balance of the vault will be incorrect . therefore, the vault will push a wrong value of _totalunderlying_ to the _xchaincontroller_  since _getvaultbalance_ is called when calculating the amount of the _totalunderlying_ . the function  _getvaultbalance is also called when determining the _amountTosendxchain_  hence incorrect amount of funds will be sent to the _xchaincontroller.

## Impact
incorrect values of total underlying will be pushed for crosschain requests and also incorrect values of funds for crosschain rebalance will be sent to the xchaincontroller.


## Code Snippet
/// @notice IMPORTANT: The negativeRewardFactor takes in account an approximation of the price of derby tokens by the dao
  /// @notice IMPORTANT: This will change to an exact price when there is a derby token liquidity pool
  /// @notice Calculates if there are any negative rewards and how many tokens to burn
  /// @param _basketId Basket ID (tokenID) in the BasketToken (NFT) contract
  /// @param _unlockedTokens Amount of derby tokens to unlock and send to user
  /// @return tokensToBurn Amount of derby tokens that are burned
  function redeemNegativeRewards(
    uint256 _basketId,
    uint256 _unlockedTokens
  ) internal returns (uint256) {
    int256 unredeemedRewards = baskets[_basketId].totalUnRedeemedRewards;
    if (unredeemedRewards > negativeRewardThreshold) return 0;

    uint256 tokensToBurn = (uint(-unredeemedRewards) * negativeRewardFactor) / 100;
    tokensToBurn = tokensToBurn < _unlockedTokens ? tokensToBurn : _unlockedTokens;

    baskets[_basketId].totalUnRedeemedRewards += int((tokensToBurn * 100) / negativeRewardFactor);

    IERC20(derbyToken).safeTransfer(homeVault, tokensToBurn);

    return tokensToBurn;
  }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a way to deduct tokentoburn in the homevault if they are transferred to prevent it from altering the balance of the homevault.
