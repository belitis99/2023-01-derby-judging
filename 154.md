# minimumPull Vault parameter cannot be adjusted

## Summary

`minimumPull` is hardcoded to be `10^6` in Vault and can't be reset thereafter.

If vault token has low decimals and high enough value, for example WBTC having 8 decimals (https://etherscan.io/token/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599#code), `minimumPull` can block funds pulling when it is needed for Vault withdrawals.

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose BTC is `USD 300k` and a new Vault has `USD 30k` AUM. If vault token is WBTC the value of `minimumPull = 0.01 WBTC` will be around `USD 3000`, which is `10%` of the Vault AUM.

In this case oftentimes withdrawals requested will not be that high, so `minimumPull` check can block substantial share of protocol withdrawals when it is needed to cover Vault LP withdrawal queue.

## Impact

Vault withdrawal requests cannot be processed for an arbitrary time while `reservedFunds` and Vault balance difference is lower than threshold, i.e. LP funds will be frozen in the Vault.

## Code Snippet

`minimumPull` is hardcoded to `10^6` on construction:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L90-L105

```solidity
  constructor(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    address _dao,
    address _controller,
    address _vaultCurrency,
    uint256 _uScale
  ) {
    controller = IController(_controller);
    vaultCurrency = IERC20(_vaultCurrency);

    vaultNumber = _vaultNumber;
    dao = _dao;
    uScale = _uScale;
    lastTimeStamp = block.timestamp;
    minimumPull = 1_000_000;
  }
```

For example, `maxDivergenceWithdraws` is hardcoded to be `10^6` in MainVault too:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L50-L68

```solidity
  constructor(
    ...
  )
    VaultToken(_name, _symbol, _decimals)
    Vault(_vaultNumber, _dao, _controller, _vaultCurrency, _uScale)
  {
    ...
    maxDivergenceWithdraws = 1_000_000;
  }
```

But it's resettable:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L418-L420

```solidity
  function setMaxDivergence(uint256 _maxDivergence) external onlyDao {
    maxDivergenceWithdraws = _maxDivergence;
  }
```

But `minimumPull` can't be reset.

It is impossible to withdraw less than `minimumPull` from protocols:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L111-L127

```solidity
  function pullFunds(uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;

      uint256 shortage = _value - vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this));
      uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(i);

      uint256 amountToWithdraw = shortage > balanceProtocol ? balanceProtocol : shortage;
      savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;

      if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) break;
      withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw);

      if (_value <= vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this))) break;
    }
  }
```

When Vault balance is lacking the LP withdrawals are blocked:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L131-L144

```solidity
  function withdraw(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver,
    address _owner
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    require(value > 0, "!value");

    require(getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds >= value, "!funds");

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    transferFunds(_receiver, value);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider introducing a setter for `minimumPull`, so it can be reset to a relevant level with regard to vault token decimals and its market value:

```solidity
  function setMinimumPull(uint256 _minimumPull) external onlyDao {
    minimumPull = _minimumPull;
  }
```

This will also allow to dynamically adjust the Vaults thereafter (say 1e6 is ok as threshold while WBTC is 20k, but becomes prohibiting when it is 200k).
