# Users can redeem more tokens

## Summary
A bad actor can call the ```claimTokens()``` to increase the underlying balance before the transaction ```pushTotalUnderlyingToController()```, then incrase exchange rate, user will redeem more tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are 8 steps for rebalancing.
Step1 : Game pushes totalDeltaAllocations to xChainController
Step2:Vaults push totalUnderlying, totalSupply and totalWithdrawalRequests to xChainController. In the ```pushTotalUnderlyingToController()``` function ,the underlying is calculated according to this formula ```savedTotalUnderlying + getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds```
```solidity
  function pushTotalUnderlyingToController() external payable onlyWhenIdle {
    require(rebalanceNeeded(), "!rebalance needed");

    setTotalUnderlying();
    uint256 underlying = savedTotalUnderlying + getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;
```

Step3:xChainController pushes exchangeRate and amount the vaults have to send back to all vaults. The new exchange rate is calculated according to the formula ```newExchangeRate = (totalUnderlying * (10 ** decimals)) / totalSupply```

If ```totalUnderlying``` increases, then the exchange rate will also increase, users will redeem more assets.
```solidity
  function pushVaultAmounts(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint16 _chain
  ) external payable onlyWhenUnderlyingsReceived(_vaultNumber) {
    address vault = getVaultAddress(_vaultNumber, _chain);
    require(vault != address(0), "xChainController: not a valid vaultnumber");
    int256 totalAllocation = getCurrentTotalAllocation(_vaultNumber);
    uint256 totalWithdrawalRequests = getTotalWithdrawalRequests(_vaultNumber);
    uint256 totalUnderlying = getTotalUnderlyingVault(_vaultNumber) - totalWithdrawalRequests;
    uint256 totalSupply = getTotalSupply(_vaultNumber);

    uint256 decimals = xProvider.getDecimals(vault);
    uint256 newExchangeRate = (totalUnderlying * (10 ** decimals)) / totalSupply;

```
The ```claimTokens()``` function can be called by anyone, the protocol will harvest extra tokens from underlying protocols and swap the govToken to underlying token. If a bad actor monitors the transactions of the mempool  and front-runs ```MainVault.pushTotalUnderlyingToController``` and call the ```claimTokens()``` function, the ```getVaultBalance()``` will increase ,then the new exchange rate will increase. User will redeem more tokens than normal.
```solidity
  function claimTokens() public {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;
      bool claim = controller.claim(vaultNumber, i);
      if (claim) {
        address govToken = controller.getGovToken(vaultNumber, i);
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20(govToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        Swap.swapTokensMulti(
          Swap.SwapInOut(tokenBalance, govToken, address(vaultCurrency)),
          controller.getUniswapParams(),
          false
        );
      }
    }
  }

```


## Impact
User will redeem more tokens and the protocol will lose assets.
