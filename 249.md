# Despite the `negativeRewardThreshold` would be defined as a state variable that a `negative value` must be assigned, `0` or `positive value` can be assigned into the `negativeRewardThreshold`

## Summary
Despite the `negativeRewardThreshold` would be defined as a state variable that a [`negative value` must be assigned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L67), `0` or `positive value` can be assigned into the `negativeRewardThreshold`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the Game, the `negativeRewardThreshold` would be defined as a state variable that must be negative like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L67-L68
```solidity
  // threshold in vaultCurrency e.g USDC for when user tokens will be sold / burned. Must be negative
  int256 internal negativeRewardThreshold;
```

Within the Game#`setNegativeRewardThreshold()`, 
the new threshold (`_threshold`) would be assigned into the `negativeRewardThreshold` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L629
```solidity
  /// @notice Setter for threshold at which user tokens will be sold / burned
  /// @param _threshold treshold in vaultCurrency e.g USDC, must be negative
  function setNegativeRewardThreshold(int256 _threshold) external onlyDao {
    negativeRewardThreshold = _threshold;
  }
```

Within the Game#`redeemNegativeRewards()`, 
the `negativeRewardThreshold` would be used for the condition like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L301
```solidity
  /// @notice IMPORTANT: The negativeRewardFactor takes in account an approximation of the price of derby tokens by the dao
  /// @notice IMPORTANT: This will change to an exact price when there is a derby token liquidity pool
  /// @notice Calculates if there are any negative rewards and how many tokens to burn
  /// @param _basketId Basket ID (tokenID) in the BasketToken (NFT) contract
  /// @param _unlockedTokens Amount of derby tokens to unlock and send to user
  /// @return tokensToBurn Amount of derby tokens that are burned
  function redeemNegativeRewards(
    uint256 _basketId,
    uint256 _unlockedTokens
  ) internal returns (uint256) {
    int256 unredeemedRewards = baskets[_basketId].totalUnRedeemedRewards;
    if (unredeemedRewards > negativeRewardThreshold) return 0;  /// @audit
    ...
    return tokensToBurn;
  }
```

However, within the Game#`setNegativeRewardThreshold()` above, there is no input validation whether or not the `negativeRewardThreshold` would be `negative value`. 
This allow the caller to accidentally assign `0` or `positive value` into the `negativeRewardThreshold` despite the `negativeRewardThreshold` would be defined as a state variable that a [`negative value` must be assigned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L67) like this:
> _// threshold in vaultCurrency e.g USDC for when user tokens will be sold / burned. Must be negative_

## Impact
Despite the `negativeRewardThreshold` would be defined as a state variable that a [`negative value` must be assigned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L67), `0` or `positive value` can be assigned into the `negativeRewardThreshold`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a validation to the Game#`setNegativeRewardThreshold()` in order to check whether or not the `negativeRewardThreshold` would be `negative value` like this:
```solidity
  function setNegativeRewardThreshold(int256 _threshold) external onlyDao {
+   require(_threshold < 0, "_threshold must be negative value");    
    negativeRewardThreshold = _threshold;
  }
```

Also, Consider adding a validation to the Game#`redeemNegativeRewards()` in order to check whether or not the `negativeRewardThreshold` would be `negative value` like this:
```solidity
  function redeemNegativeRewards(
    uint256 _basketId,
    uint256 _unlockedTokens
  ) internal returns (uint256) {
    int256 unredeemedRewards = baskets[_basketId].totalUnRedeemedRewards;
+   require(negativeRewardThreshold < 0, "negativeRewardThreshold must be negative value");    
    if (unredeemedRewards > negativeRewardThreshold) return 0;
    ...
    return tokensToBurn;
  }
```
