# Yearn Vault using _shares to processd withdraws from vault, not amount of asset

## Summary
based on the yVault.sol contract, this contract is using the number of shares in withdraw function and not the number of assets.

## Vulnerability Detail
if you check yVault.sol contract, at yVault.sol#L101, withdraw function is using (uint256 _shares) to process withdraw requests,

>     function withdraw(uint256 _shares) public {
>     }

but in the YearnProvider.sol#L45 from derby-yield-optimiser, for process withdraw, we get _amount as input and based on comment, _amount = Amount to withdraw.

>   /// @notice Withdraw the underlying asset from Yearn
>   /// @dev Pulls cTokens from Vault, redeem them from Yearn, send underlying back.
>   /// @param _amount Amount to withdraw
>   /// @param _yToken Address of protocol LP Token eg yUSDC
>   /// @param _uToken Address of underlying Token eg USDC
>   /// @return Underlying tokens received and sent to vault e.g USDC
>   function withdraw(
>     uint256 _amount,
>     address _yToken,
>     address _uToken
>   ) external override returns (uint256) {

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the withdraw() function in YearnProvider.sol, calculate the price per share and use that to retrieve the correct number of underlying assets.
