# Change `vaultUnderlyingAddress` in `XChainController.sol` (function `setVaultChainAddress`) could completely break a contract

## Summary
In contract `XChainController.sol` exists function `setVaultChainAddress(uint256 _vaultNumber, uint32 _chainId, address _address, address _underlying)` with which invocation, and change `vaultUnderlyingAddress` address could completely break a contract, because of using `balanceOf` function through this contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `setVaultChainAddress` change the `vaultUnderlyingAddress` address which could completely break a contract if it changed after initial (first) setup.

## Impact
With the change `vaultUnderlyingAddress` address after initial (first) setup, it will completely break the connection between the `XChainController` contract address, and the `vaultUnderlyingAddress` address. For example, in the function `sendFundsToVault`, the value for `balance` (line https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L423) will be wrong if `vaultUnderlyingAddress` changed after initial (first) setup.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add check in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L548 that if `vaults[_vaultNumber].vaultUnderlyingAddress[_chainId] ` different than zero, it reverts this function
```solidity
function setVaultChainAddress(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint32 _chainId,
    address _address,
    address _underlying
  ) external onlyDao {
    require(vaults[_vaultNumber].vaultUnderlyingAddress[_chainId] == address(0), "vaultUnderlyingAddress must be zero");
    vaults[_vaultNumber].vaultChainAddress[_chainId] = _address;
    vaults[_vaultNumber].vaultUnderlyingAddress[_chainId] = _underlying;
  }
```
