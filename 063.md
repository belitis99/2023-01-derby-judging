# Vault will revert when depositing into a protocol with USDT as the underlying token

## Summary
Vault will revert when depositing into a protocol with USDT as the underlying token.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Vault.depositInProtocol()` the `ERC20(underlying).safeIncreaseAllowance()` function is called. But, not every ERC20 token supports that function, e.g. [USDT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code). It's not part of the [specs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#specification).

Derby expects to use protocols where the underlying token is USDT: https://derby-finance.gitbook.io/derby-finance-docs/products/vaults. While the vault only accepts USDC deposits, those are swapped to USDT and DAI for certain protocols. Because the function doesn't exist in the USDT contract, the call will revert. That will break the `rebalance()` function since `depositInProtocol()` is part of that. For the Vault to function, the USDT protocol has to be blacklisted.

## Impact
Protocols with USDT as the underlying token are incompatible with the Vault contract. They will cause the `rebalance()` function to revert.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L299
```sol
  /// @notice Deposit amount to underlying protocol
  /// @dev Deposits VaultCurrency in Protocol e.g USDC
  /// @param _protocolNum Protocol number linked to an underlying protocol e.g compound_usdc_01
  /// @param _amount in VaultCurrency to deposit
  function depositInProtocol(uint256 _protocolNum, uint256 _amount) internal {
    IController.ProtocolInfoS memory protocol = controller.getProtocolInfo(
      vaultNumber,
      _protocolNum
    );

    if (getVaultBalance() < _amount) _amount = getVaultBalance();

    if (protocol.underlying != address(vaultCurrency)) {
      _amount = Swap.swapStableCoins(
        Swap.SwapInOut(_amount, address(vaultCurrency), protocol.underlying),
        uScale,
        controller.underlyingUScale(protocol.underlying),
        controller.getCurveParams(address(vaultCurrency), protocol.underlying)
      );
    }

    IERC20(protocol.underlying).safeIncreaseAllowance(protocol.provider, _amount);
    IProvider(protocol.provider).deposit(_amount, protocol.LPToken, protocol.underlying);
  }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use SafeERC20's `safeIncreaseAllowance()` function instead of calling the ERC20 contract directly.
