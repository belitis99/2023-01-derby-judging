# Users might lose funds when using withdrawAllowance().

## Summary
Users always lose some funds when user.withdrawalAllowance is greater than vault balance.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L238-L245
When using withdrawAllowance(), it checks the vault balance and if the vault balance is lower than user.withdrawalAllowance, value will be equal vault balance.  


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L242
It reverts when the difference is higher than maxDivergenceWithdraws, but still, users are losing funds. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L175
It deletes user.withdrawalAllowance instead of user.withdrawalAllowance - value. 
## Impact
Users will lose their remaining funds and can't receive them next time.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
user.withdrawalAllowance = user.withdrawalAllowance - value;
```
So When the vault has funds, users can withdraw their remaining funds.
