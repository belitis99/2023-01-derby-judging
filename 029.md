# pushVaultAmounts can be called multiple times if in the right state

## Summary
In `XChainController`, `pushVaultAmounts` can be called multiple times on same vault, 
calling `sendXChainAmount` and sending funds cross chain multiple times and breaking protocol accounting.   

## Vulnerability Detail
In `XChainController`, pushVaultAmounts:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L295-L324

can be called by anybody and does not check it has already been called with current allocations, which means that it will execute its action every time it is called. 

## Impact
Protocol accounting is completely broken as a result, leading to funds being stuck on a chain due to being unaccounted for

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Cache the allocations on which `pushVaultAmount` has already been called, so only the difference is forwarded cross chain, or find a way to check if a cross chain action has already been sent.
