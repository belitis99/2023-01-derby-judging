# Rounding error in storePriceAndRewards leads to loss of rewards

## Summary
In Vault.sol: when calling `storePriceAndRewards`, the difference of exchange rate for LP tokens to underlying is used to determine the rewards to accrue (for example the difference exchange rate from cUSDC to USDC).
However if the difference is small, and underlying tokens have low decimals (such as USDC with 6 decimals) the rounding error can round rewards to zero. 

## Vulnerability Detail
As seen in `storePriceAndRewards`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L226-L245

priceDiff:
`int256 priceDiff = int256(currentPrice - lastPrices[_protocolId]);`
can be a small 1e18 precision number (~1e16 is plausible)

_totalUnderlying is 1e6 precision number in the case of USDC

performanceFee is lower than 100

so 
`int256 nominator = (int256(_totalUnderlying * performanceFee) * priceDiff);`
is a 1e26 number

on the other hand `denominator`:
`int256 denominator = totalAllocatedTokensRounded * int256(lastPrices[_protocolId]) * 100;`

is a 1e38 number (totalAllocatedTokensRounded is 1e18).

It is very likely that the result of the division is rounded down to zero.

## Impact
Rewards are not distributed to protocol participants

## Recommendation
If rewards is zero, do not update `lastPrices[_protocolId]`
