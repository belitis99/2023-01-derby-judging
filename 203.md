# Cross chain rebalance timestamps may drift from each other

## Summary
vaults use different timestamps (`lastTimeStamp`) on each chain to track if a rebalance is needed or not. These timestamps are set by independent, unpermissioned functions, and can drift over time, making it impossible to rebalance and paralyzing the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
Vaults can send their underlying amounts to trigger step 2 of cross chain rebalancing, by using function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L257-L259

only if `rebalanceNeeded()` returns true, which is implemented as:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L437-L440

The call of this function will trigger the update of lastTimeStamp value:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L275

However it is impossible to make sure that these calls are made exactly at the same time accross chains. Since these calls are unpermissioned, a guardian cannot block a user from performing the call if it needs to be performed later (to reduce cross chain drift). 

## Impact
Slowly the protocol takes more and more time to execute a rebalancing because of the discrepancies of lastTimeStamp cross-chain. This can impact user actions since users are forbidden to withdraw/deposit from vaults during a rebalancing.

## Recommendation
Use a centralized timestamp value to decide if rebalancing should happen.
