# Not enough input sanitisation in providers can lead to fund loss.

## Summary

This vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitisation in providers, which can lead to a loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

Taking an example of `YearnProvider` the `deposit` function doesn’t have enough access control or input sanitisation for the provided parameters. 

```solidity
function deposit(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _yToken,
    address _uToken
  ) external override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(address(this));

    IERC20(_uToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    IERC20(_uToken).safeIncreaseAllowance(_yToken, _amount);

    uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    require((balanceAfter - balanceBefore - _amount) == 0, "Error Deposit: under/overflow");

    uint256 yTokenReceived = IYearn(_yToken).deposit(_amount);
    IYearn(_yToken).transfer(msg.sender, yTokenReceived);

    return yTokenReceived;
  }
```

In the function above, an attacker can pass in a malicious `_uToken` that they deployed themselves. 
They’d have to return two different values of the function call `balanceOf` and would just need to implement two more functions `safeTransferFrom` and `safeIncreaseAllowance`. 

Eg: `_uToken` = malicious contract address. 

First call to `balanceOf` returns 0e18 and second call returns 1000e18, and value of `_amount` = 1000e18.

This will make the require statement true as `balanceBefore` = 0e18 , `balanceAfter` = 1000e18 and `_amount` = 1000e18.

This way the remaining calls to _yToken.deposit and _yToken.transfer would be successfully executed if there are sufficient funds in the contract, and the attacker would receive the funds.

## Impact

The impact of these attacks can be significant, resulting in the loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent this vulnerability, input sanitisation should be implemented in all provider inputs. Check if the tokens passed in the arguments are legitimate by maintaining a whitelist.
