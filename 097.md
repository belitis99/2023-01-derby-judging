# Due to incorrect way of tracking rewards by LP's an attacker can receive an unfair share of yield accumulated in MainVault.sol

## Summary
The docs mentions "Note that the user will be generating yield with our vault LP tokens from the moment of depositing funds." 

While the vault tracks how many LP's an user has, it does not take into account when a user deposits and received these LP's. A user that deposits into the vault just after a rebalance and a user that deposits into the vault just before the next rebalance (after approx. 2 weeks) are the same.

Since the rebalance period is known and is timed an attacker could deposit just before a rebalance and withdraw just after the rebalance is done, taking up the yield while not actually contributing to the protocol. The attacker could deposit a high amount which could lead to accumulating a big portion of the yield.

## Vulnerability Detail
Step 1:
Just before a rebalance, an attacker uses the MainVault.deposit() function to receive LP's
e.g. deposits 100 USDC at an exchangeRate of 2$/LP = 50LP's.

Step 2 (optional):
Also before rebalance, to assure the attacker can withdraw, calls the MainVault.withdrawalRequest() to ensure a withdrawal after rebalance.

Step 3:
The rebalance happens and the new exchangeRate is set (2.1$/LP).
The attacker withdraws 50LP's and receives 2.1*50=105
The 5$ is actually yield that has been accumulated by users that have had their assets deposited in the protocols. 

## Impact
Attacker can receive an unfair share amount of yield

## Recommendation
Track the timestamp of the user when depositing (like Uniswap/ Masterchef).
