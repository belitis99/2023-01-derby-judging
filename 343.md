# Attacker can use a mock token contract to bypass checks in different providers and steal funds.

## Summary

Some provider contracts do not validate the users input addresses which allows any attacker to simply create a mock contract and satisfy the input validation requirements.

## Vulnerability Detail

See Summary, Impact and Code Snippet

## Impact

Anyone can steal funds through some of the provider contracts.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
  /// @notice Withdraw the underlying asset from Aave
  /// @dev Pulls cTokens from Vault, redeem them from Aave, send underlying back.
  /// @param _amount Amount to withdraw
  /// @param _uToken Address of underlying Token eg USDC
  /// @param _aToken Address of protocol LP Token eg aUSDC
  /// @return Underlying tokens received and sent to vault e.g USDC
  function withdraw(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _aToken,
    address _uToken
  ) external override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(msg.sender);

    require(
      IAToken(_aToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount) == true, // @audit user can pass mock contract for _aToken
      "Error: transferFrom"
    );
    uint256 uTokensReceived = IALendingPool(IAToken(_aToken).POOL()).withdraw( // @audit user can pass mock contract for _aToken which returns a valid aave pool adresses
      IAToken(_aToken).UNDERLYING_ASSET_ADDRESS(),  // @audit user can pass mock contract for _aToken which returns a valid underlying asset address
      _amount,
      msg.sender
    );

    uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(msg.sender); // @audit user can pass mock contract for _uToken

    require(
      (balanceAfter - balanceBefore - uTokensReceived) == 0,
      "Error Withdraw: under/overflow"
    );

    return uTokensReceived;
  }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Create a source of truth mapping with tokens and protocol contracts addresses in order to not depend on external input addresses.
