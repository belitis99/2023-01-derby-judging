# On-chain slippage calculation can be manipulated, causing stealing of rewards in sandwich attacks

## Summary
The slippage tolerance calculation in `Swap.swapTokensMulti` can be manipulated and the price at which reward tokens are sold for the vault's underlying token can be maliciously decreased to benefit the attacker. As a result, depositors may receive less funds than expected.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol integrates with third-party vaults (e.g. Aave, Compound, Yearn, etc.), in which it deposits user funds to generate yield. Some of the third-party vaults (at the moment, only Compound) reward their users with protocol tokens (COMP, in the case of Compound). These tokens can be claimed and sold for the underlying token of the vaults (e.g. USDC):
1. [during rebalancing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L141);
1. at any moment by calling [claimTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L404).

The [Swap.swapTokensMulti](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/libraries/Swap.sol#L64) function, which is responsible for selling tokens on Uniswap, calculates the slippage tolerance of a swap by [querying the official Uniswap Quoter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/libraries/Swap.sol#L71) contract: the returned amount is used as the [minimal amount of tokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/libraries/Swap.sol#L90) the swap must result in.

However, the `Quoter` contract is vulnerable to price manipulation attacks since it simply [performs a swap](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/lens/QuoterV2.sol#L138-L146) in the underlying Uniswap pools. A malicious actor can execute a sandwich attack, which will:
1. manipulate the price of a Uniswap pool that swaps a reward token;
1. cause a call to `claimTokens` to sell reward tokens at a manipulated price, which will be lower than the market price;
1. return the price in th pool back, profiting from the reward tokens sold below the market price.

This attack can be run against any transaction that calls `claimTokens`, which can damage and depositor in Derby vaults.
## Impact
Gamers and depositors can receive less yield due to the vulnerability. Since reward tokens are often used by protocols to promote and incentivize liquidity provision, reward tokens can generate a higher APY than the main mechanism of the vault. In this case, stealing rewards may dramatically reduce profits of gamers and depositors and it may disrupt the main innovative mechanism of Derby: protocols with high allocation may in reality generate less yield than protocols with lower allocations that don't issue reward tokens.
## Code Snippet
1. `ClaimTokens` sells the reward token for the underlying token:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L404
1. `ClaimToken` is called during rebalancing:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L141
1. The proceedings from selling reward tokens increase the total number of underlying tokens during rebalancing:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L158-L164
1. `Swap.swapTokensMulti` performs on-chain slippage tolerance calculation, which is vulnerable to price manipulation:

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
In the `Swap.swapTokensMulti` function, consider letting the caller set the value of `amountOutMinimum`. The value should be calculated off-chain by the caller before the transaction is sentâ€“this doesn't allow MEV bots to manipulate the price.

Also, consider making the `Vault.claimTokens` function restricted so that it couldn't be called by a MEV bot with `amountOutMinimum` set to 0. As long as `Vault.claimTokens` remains public and unrestricted, it can be called by MEV bots with a too big slippage tolerance, which will let them sandwich the swap and steal a portion of reward tokens.
