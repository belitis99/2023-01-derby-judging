# pushTotalUnderlyingToController can still be called even if the vault is inactive

## Summary
pushTotalUnderlyingToController can still be called even when the vault is inactive. 
This can have 1 of 2 outcomes:
1. xChainController proceeds with the rebalancing process (after pushVaultAmounts has been called) when not every active vaults has called pushTotalUnderlyingToController
2. xChainController's pushVaultAmounts can't be called, causing the rebalancing process to fail

## Vulnerability Detail

pushTotalUnderlyingToController can still be called when it's inactive.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L288
Calling vault's pushTotalUnderlyingToController causes xChainController to increment underlyingReceived.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L106-L112
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L295-L298
xChainController only proceeds with pushVaultAmounts when all active vaults has called pushTotalUnderlyingToController. However, since inactive vaults can also call pushTotalUnderlyingToController, the checks no longer ensure this.

## Impact

Suppose the vault is active on 5 chains, and inactive on another 5. (i.e. vaultStage[_vaultNumber].activeVaults = 5). Also assume that the vault is ready for rebalancing.
Consider situation 1. An attacker calls pushTotalUnderlyingToController on 2 active vaults and 3 inactive vaults, and immediately calls (frontrunning any automated calls) xChainController's pushVaultAmounts.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L286
totalUnderlying is now much lower than it actually is since not all active vaults have pushed their totalUnderlying.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L303-L320
This affects the exchangeRate and the amount of assets allocated to each chain.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L322
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L121
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L155
The incorrect exchangeRate gets pushed to the vault, impacting the withdraw & deposit functions of the vault. This can cause users to incur a loss.

Also, since the amount of assets allocated to each chain is incorrect (lower), the vault has to send much more funds to the xChainController than necessary.

Now consider situation 2. An attacker calls pushTotalUnderlyingToController on all 10 vaults. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L106-L112
This check will fail (10 != 5) even though all active vaults has called pushTotalUnderlyingToController.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L295-L298
pushVaultAmounts will now fail, thus interrupting the rebalancing process.

## Recommendation
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L249
pushTotalUnderlyingToController should only be called if the vault is active. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L75
So, it's better to use the onlyWhenVaultIsOn modifier.
