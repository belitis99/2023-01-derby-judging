# Vault.rebalance assumes stablecoin price parity and will revert if it cannot make the swap, locking user funds.

## Summary

Vault.rebalance assumes stablecoin price parity and makes a swap according to this when rebalancing.

## Vulnerability Detail

During a turbulent market or stablecoin bankrun, the USDC/(USDT/DAI) price can deviate from 1:1. `Vault.rebalance` calls

- rebalanceCheckProtocols
- executeDeposits

These functions swap stable tokens on Curve. The amountOutMin is calculated with the assumption of 1:1 price, excluding pool fee.

```solidity
uint256 amountOutMin = (((_swap.amount * (10000 - _curve.poolFee)) / 10000) * _tokenOutUScale) / _tokenInUScale;
```

Now, when USDT/USDC price is 0.9, the protocol tries to swap 1USDC for 1USDT. But that swap fails because prices have deviated. Now the vault is locked because rebalance flow cannot complete.

## Impact

User cannot call `withdraw`, `withdrawRewards`, `withdrawAllowance`. These functions require the vault to be in  idle state.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
uint256 amountOutMin = (((_swap.amount * (10000 - _curve.poolFee)) / 10000) * _tokenOutUScale) / _tokenInUScale;
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use price oracles to verify pairâ€™s 1:1 price. Input expected price on rebalance function.
