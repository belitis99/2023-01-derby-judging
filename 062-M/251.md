# Inequality sign used in the condition within the Game#`redeemNegativeRewards()` would be incorrect

## Summary
Inequality sign used in the condition within the Game#`redeemNegativeRewards()` would be incorrect.
This lead to un-expected behavior that even if the `unredeemedRewards` would be positive, `0` will be returned as the `tokensToBurn` that the amount of Derby tokens to be burned.


## Vulnerability Detail
Within the Game, the `negativeRewardThreshold` would be defined that must be negative like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L67-L68
```solidity
  // threshold in vaultCurrency e.g USDC for when user tokens will be sold / burned. Must be negative
  int256 internal negativeRewardThreshold;
```

Within the Game#`setNegativeRewardThreshold()`,
the new threshold (`_threshold`) would be assigned into the `negativeRewardThreshold` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L629
```solidity
  /// @notice Setter for threshold at which user tokens will be sold / burned
  /// @param _threshold treshold in vaultCurrency e.g USDC, must be negative
  function setNegativeRewardThreshold(int256 _threshold) external onlyDao {
    negativeRewardThreshold = _threshold;
  }
```

Within the Game#`redeemNegativeRewards()`,
the `negativeRewardThreshold` would be used for the condition like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L301
```solidity
  /// @notice IMPORTANT: The negativeRewardFactor takes in account an approximation of the price of derby tokens by the dao
  /// @notice IMPORTANT: This will change to an exact price when there is a derby token liquidity pool
  /// @notice Calculates if there are any negative rewards and how many tokens to burn
  /// @param _basketId Basket ID (tokenID) in the BasketToken (NFT) contract
  /// @param _unlockedTokens Amount of derby tokens to unlock and send to user
  /// @return tokensToBurn Amount of derby tokens that are burned
  function redeemNegativeRewards(
    uint256 _basketId,
    uint256 _unlockedTokens
  ) internal returns (uint256) {
    int256 unredeemedRewards = baskets[_basketId].totalUnRedeemedRewards;
    if (unredeemedRewards > negativeRewardThreshold) return 0;  /// @audit
    ...
    return tokensToBurn;
  }
```

Within the Game#`redeemNegativeRewards()` above,  `0` is supposed to be returned as the `tokensToBurn` only when the `unredeemedRewards` would be below the `negativeRewardThreshold`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L301
```solidity
if (unredeemedRewards > negativeRewardThreshold) return 0;
```
However, if current inequality sign would be used as it is within the condition above, `0` will be returned as the `tokensToBurn` only when the `unredeemedRewards` would be above the `negativeRewardThreshold`.

As a result, even if the `unredeemedRewards` would be positive, `0` will be returned as the `tokensToBurn` that the amount of Derby tokens to be burned.


## Impact
This lead to un-expected behavior that even if the `unredeemedRewards` would be positive, `0` will be  returned as the `tokensToBurn` that the amount of Derby tokens to be burned.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider fixing the inequality sign in the condition within the Game#`redeemNegativeRewards()` in order to return `0` only when the `unredeemedRewards` would be below the `negativeRewardThreshold` like this:
```solidity
  function redeemNegativeRewards(
    uint256 _basketId,
    uint256 _unlockedTokens
  ) internal returns (uint256) {
    int256 unredeemedRewards = baskets[_basketId].totalUnRedeemedRewards;
+   if (unredeemedRewards < negativeRewardThreshold) return 0;
-   if (unredeemedRewards > negativeRewardThreshold) return 0;
    ...
    return tokensToBurn;
  }
```
