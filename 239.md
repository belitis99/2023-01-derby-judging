# XChainController does not reset vault's totalWithdrawalRequests

## Summary
XChainController does not reset vault's totalWithdrawalRequests. This creates many problems - from incorrect exchange rate to DOS from potential arithmetic underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L287
Observe that setUnderlying increases the totalWithdrawalRequests instead of setting it.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L179
resetVaultUnderlying doesn't reset it to 0.

In fact, it's easy to verify with a quick search, that the value of totalWithdrawalRequests in XChainController will never decrease. Clearly, this is incorrect.

## Impact
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L303-L307
Since the value of totalWithdrawalRequests is much higher than the actual value of total withdrawal requests, the value of totalUnderlying and exchangeRate will be incorrect. Furthermore, arithmetic underflow will also happen when totalWithdrawalRequests is sufficiently large, causing DOS.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L322
The incorrect exchange rate is pushed to the vault.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L121
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L155
This impacts the withdraw & deposit functions of the vault, potentially causing users to incur a loss.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L310
Additionally, the amount of assets allocated to the vault will be incorrect (lower) as well since it's calculated with totalUnderlying. This forces the vault to send much more funds to the xChainController than necessary.

Also, observe that there are no guardian functions that directly set the value of totalWithdrawalRequests in XChainController, so this problem can't be resolved manually.

## Recommendation
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L179
I believe resetVaultUnderlying should also reset totalWithdrawalRequests to 0.
