# Blacklisted protocol will block all allocations to a vault and disable game.

## Summary
When any protocol is blacklisted in a vault, it prevents game from pushing protocol allocations into the vault - as long as there is any non-zero allocation into that protocol. Since the allocations are submitted by the users an the game does not in anyway check for blacklisting and does not prevent users from doing it, this is a realistic possibility.
Moreover, the attempted allocation reverts - I don't know if that propagates xchain, but in a same chain call that will revert the whole game's push allocation, disabling it's function altogether. Even if the allocation succeeds, the vault that did not update will prevent further steps.
## Vulnerability Detail
Through Game::rebalanceBasket() a user submits new allocations for protocols. Through Game::settleDeltaAllocations() and Game::addDeltaAllocationProtocol() these are added into the Game's totals. There is no limitation on the vallues of those allocations other than their number matching the total number of protocols.

The protocols come into play again in Step 6 of the Game. Game::pushAllocationsToVaults() where these per-protocol totals are sent into the vaults. That leads to MainVault's

Which skips zero allocations, but if not, calls
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L396-L400
Which, for a blacklisted protocol, reverts - in turn reverting the whole vault allocations update, leaving it in a state of deltaAllocationsReceived = false and preventing further steps. Moreover the revert propagates (at least for same chain, I don't know if xchain call) back into the game, reverting the whole allocations push.

Since those allocations are submitting by the users, there is no check, and there is no way to manually change them either, this will KO the whole game for good.
## Impact
Disabling the whole Game.

## Recommendation
There is no easy fix. A quick one would be to skip blacklisted protocols in the Vault update instead of reverting, but that would still mean wrong allocations were accepted. A correct way would mean informing the game about blacklisting and not allowing allocations to them from the start.
