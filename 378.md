# `connext` address is immutable

## Summary
Connext address used by the XProvider to make all cross chain messaging / calls is [immutable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L17).

## Vulnerability Detail
The connext contract is used for all cross chain messaging / transfer and cannot be changed.

## Impact
If the Connext team updates their contract for security reasons, the Derby Protocol cannot be update it.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  address public immutable connext;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the immutable attribute to the `connext` variable and add a setter accessible for guardian / dao users.
