# Users can game the withdrawal system to prevent losing LP token value

## Summary

A user can prevent being impacted from a decline in LP token value by submitting a withdrawal request even when there is enough funds in the vault and when they have no intention of withdrawing. When the LP token declines in value, the user can claim their LP tokens at the higher price.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Alice has 10 LP tokens worth a total of 1000 USD
2. Alice wants to ensure she doesn't lose her 1000 USD worth of tokens in the event of a negative price swing
3. Alice decides to create a withdrawal request so she can claim her allowance of 1000 USD when the value of the the LP token declines
4. The value of 10 LP tokens decline to 500 USD after a few months
5. Alice claims her withdrawalAllowance for 1000 USD value while the value of LP tokens is 500 USD

This is ultimately an accounting error that benefits users and hurts the protocol.

## Impact

The Derby protocol would be incurring a loss due to users being able to cheat the system whenever there are negative price changes in the LP token. This would also inadvertently make negative price swings worse because the more users that catch on to this vulnerability, the more users will cash out their high allowances during negative price action.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L149-L162

1. On line 155 a user can lock in the value of their withdrawal

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L166-L179

2. On line 178, the user initiates the claim for their locked value even when the actual value is much lower

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L184-L188

3. On line 188 the user is successfully sent their locked value

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a require check to ensure that a user is not creating a withdrawal request when the vault does indeed have funds AND incorporate proper logic to account for price swings of LP tokens in the time span between a withdrawal request and allowance withdrawal.
