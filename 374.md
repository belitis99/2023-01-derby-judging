# Unexpected user can make deposit if training variable is not setted to true

## Summary
Unexpected user can make deposit if training variable is not setted to true

## Vulnerability Detail
`Training` is used in the `deposit` function. When true the maximum amount a user can deposit is capped to `maxTrainingDeposit` and only whitelisted addresses will be able to deposit. This will be true at launch. When everything is working correctly it will be set to false. Before  the 'taste' phase of the protocol unexpected user can make deposit.

## Impact
The `training` storage variable should be setted to false when everything is working correctly but before that should be true. Unexpected user can make deposit before the variable to be setted to true because by default variable is false and is not initillized  in constructor.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set variable to be true in constructor.

```solidity
  constructor(
    string memory _name,
    string memory _symbol,
    uint8 _decimals,
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    address _dao,
    address _game,
    address _controller,
    address _vaultCurrency,
    uint256 _uScale
  )
    VaultToken(_name, _symbol, _decimals)
    Vault(_vaultNumber, _dao, _controller, _vaultCurrency, _uScale)
  {
    training = true,
    exchangeRate = _uScale;
    game = _game;
    governanceFee = 0;
    maxDivergenceWithdraws = 1_000_000;
  }
```
