# Aave provider using fixed Exchange Rates.

## Summary

The aave exchange rate is fixed to 1, which isn’t always the case. The value should be fetched from an oracle instead.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `AaveProvider` the function `exchangeRate` is defined as follows :

```solidity
function exchangeRate(address _aToken) public pure override returns (uint256) {
    return 1;
  }
```

Here is assumes that the aUSDC/USDC price would always be 1:1 , which isn’t always the case, for example in the latest USDC depeg, the ratio was changed by a slight difference.

## Impact

Returning wrong price for the LP token might lead to some fund loss, and lead to extra rewards being takes from the protocol.

## Recommendation

Use an oracle to fetch the latest price.
