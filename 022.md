# Do not follow check-effect-interaction pattern

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
To avoid unexpected behavior in the future (be it for the solution or for a fork), it's recommended to always follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern.

Consider always moving the state-changes before the external calls.

## Impact
Failure to follow the CEI pattern can have significant impacts on the security and stability of a smart contract, potentially leading to reentrancy attacks, race conditions, unexpected behavior, and other vulnerabilities.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L365-L367
```solidity
  function sendRewardsToGame() external payable {
    require(state == State.SendRewardsPerToken, stateError);

    int256[] memory rewards = rewardsToArray();
    IXProvider(xProvider).pushRewardsToGame{value: msg.value}(vaultNumber, homeChain, rewards);

    state = State.Idle; //@audit - state changes happen after pushRewardsToGame
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L150-L153
```solidity
    if (reservedFunds > vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this))) pullFunds(reservedFunds);

    state = State.SendRewardsPerToken; //@audit - state changes happen after pullFunds
    deltaAllocationsReceived = false; 
  }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L472-L476
```solidity
    IXProvider(xProvider).pushProtocolAllocationsToVault{value: msg.value}(_chain, vault, deltas);

    emit PushProtocolAllocations(_chain, getVaultAddress(_vaultNumber, _chain), deltas);

    isXChainRebalancing[_vaultNumber][_chain] = false; //@audit - state changes happen after pushProtocolAllocationsToVault
```
