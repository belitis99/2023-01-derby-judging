# multiple withdrawalRequest before the first rebalance will burn LPTokens but only give underlying for the last request

## Summary
If a user does multiple withdrawalRequests during the first period the last one will overwrite the previous ones but LPTokens will be burnt for all of them.

## Vulnerability Detail
When doing a `withdrawalRequest` there is a check that there isn't a current withdrawal request:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L153

However, vaults start in `rebalancingPeriod` as 0, so a user can do multiple withdrawal requests before the first rebalance is done. 

The state of how much the user is withdrawing is kept in `user.withdrawalAllowance` and `totalWithdrawalRequests`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L157-L161

When the rebalance is done, the `totalWithdrawalRequests` is transferred to `reservedFunds`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L336-L340

Then the user can withdraw their allowance:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L171-L178

Since the value is overwritten in `user.withdrawalAllowance = value;` if a user does multiple withdrawalRequests only the last one is saved, but LPTokens are burnt for all of them. `totalWithdrawalRequests` is also increased for all of them so the lost funds will be locked in `reservedFunds`.

PoC test in `VaultWithdraw.test.ts`
```javascript
  it('double withdrawalRequest will burn LPTokens but not give underlying', async function () {
    const { vault, user } = await setupVault();
    await vault.connect(user).deposit(parseUSDC(10_000), user.address); // 10k
    expect(await vault.totalSupply()).to.be.equal(parseUSDC(10_000)); // 10k

    // withdrawal request for 10k LP tokens
    await expect(() =>
      vault.connect(user).withdrawalRequest(parseUSDC(5_000)),
    ).to.changeTokenBalance(vault, user, -parseUSDC(5_000));
    
    expect(await vault.getTotalWithdrawalRequestsTEST()).to.be.equal(parseUSDC(5_000));

    // twice
    await expect(() =>
      vault.connect(user).withdrawalRequest(parseUSDC(5_000)),
    ).to.changeTokenBalance(vault, user, -parseUSDC(5_000));

    // pending requests increased
    expect(await vault.getTotalWithdrawalRequestsTEST()).to.be.equal(parseUSDC(10_000));

    // check withdrawalAllowance user and totalsupply
    expect(await vault.connect(user).getWithdrawalAllowance()).to.be.equal(parseUSDC(5_000));
    expect(await vault.totalSupply()).to.be.equal(parseUSDC(0));

    // trying to withdraw allowance before the vault reserved the funds
    await expect(vault.connect(user).withdrawAllowance()).to.be.revertedWith('');

    // mocking vault settings
    await vault.upRebalancingPeriodTEST();
    await vault.setReservedFundsTEST(parseUSDC(10_000));

    // withdraw allowance will give 5k
    await expect(() => vault.connect(user).withdrawAllowance()).to.changeTokenBalance(
      IUSDc,
      user,
      parseUSDC(5_000),
    );

    // trying to withdraw allowance again will fail
    await expect(vault.connect(user).withdrawAllowance()).to.be.revertedWith('!Allowance');

    // funds stuck in reserved
    expect(await vault.getReservedFundsTEST()).to.be.equal(parseUSDC(5_000));
  });
```

## Impact
User has their funds locked in `reservedFunds` which will be kept in the vault forever.

## Tool used
Manual Review, hardhat

## Recommendation
The protocol can allow multiple withdrawal requests in the same period by adding the allowance to the previous:

This is safe because the value is zeroed when the user does `withdrawAllowance`:

Or, initialize the `rebalancingPeriod` to 1

this might have other implications though.
