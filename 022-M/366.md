# Protocol may experience loss due to high slippage during `rebalanceXChain` or `sendFundsToVault`

## Summary
The Derby protocol relies on functions triggered by external entities and the slippage parameter can be maliciously chosen.

## Vulnerability Detail
The functions [`rebalanceXChain`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L307) and [`sendFundsToVault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L411) are part of these functions, anyone call execute them.
The caller is able to specify a high slippage parameters and can cause harm to the protocol.

Any user could grief the Derby Protocol by setting a high slippage value during `rebalanceXChain` or `sendFundsToVault` calls.

## Impact
In regards to recent events with USDC depeg. A malicious user could cause loss of assets during the rebalance accross chains.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function rebalanceXChain(uint256 _slippage, uint256 _relayerFee) external payable { 
...
}

  function sendFundsToVault(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint256 _slippage,
    uint32 _chain,
    uint256 _relayerFee
  ) external payable onlyWhenFundsReceived(_vaultNumber) {
...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Slippage should be set in the protocol and could be updated by DAO of Guardians of the protocol.
