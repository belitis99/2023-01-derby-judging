# Swaps have no slippage protection.

## Summary
Uniswap swaps offer no slippage protection and can be frontrun / sandwiched.
## Vulnerability Detail
swapTokensMulti in libraries/Swap.sol uses the uniswap quoter in an apparent attempt to get a correct price for slippage protection, but this method actually does nothing of that sort and, by uniswap documentation, should not be used in a contract at all.

## Impact
User calls of Vault::claimTokens() and Vault::withdrawRewards() can be exploited for attacker profit through frontrunning / sandwiching.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the quoter the way it was meant to be used - in the frontend - and add some slippage margin to the user call.
