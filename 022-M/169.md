# The funds could stack during the cross-chain rebalancing

## Summary
[sendFundsToVault()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L409-L441) and [rebalanceXChain()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L307-L326) have a param `_slippage` (Slippage tolerance for xChain swap, in BPS)
So, the users could set the `_slippage` to any value

## Vulnerability Detail
in case, it's a cross-chain rebalancing
and the user set `_slippage` to a small number 

Frome Connext docs 
[If fast liquidity is not available, then the message will go through the slow path](https://docs.connext.network/concepts/how-it-works/transaction-flow#fast-path).
Also, [If slippage is too high on the destination swap (after it has already gone through the origin swap)](https://docs.connext.network/developers/guides/handling-failures#high-slippage)
You can't cancel the transfer and bridge back to the origin.
so it will just: Wait out until slippage conditions improve (relayers will continuously re-attempt the transfer execution).
and this could take days (this will lead both users and game players to gain no reward and the protocol will be stuck during the cross-chain rebalancing )

one thing you can do it here is to **Increase the slippage tolerance**
The `_delegate` parameter of [xcall()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L152-L160) is an address that has rights to update the original slippage tolerance
But, In case you invoke `sendFundsToVault()`. the `_delegate` will be the address of `XChainController.sol`

## Impact
The funds could stack during the cross-chain rebalancing until slippage conditions improve

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff 
    IConnext(connext).xcall{value: (msg.value - _relayerFee)}(
      _destinationDomain, // _destination: Domain ID of the destination chain
      _recipient, // _to: address receiving the funds on the destination
      _token, // _asset: address of the token contract
-     msg.sender, // _delegate: address that can revert or forceLocal on destination
+    guardian, // _delegate: address that can revert or forceLocal on destination
      _amount, // _amount: amount of tokens to transfer
      _slippage, // _slippage: the maximum amount of slippage the user will accept in BPS (e.g. 30 = 0.3%)
      bytes("") // _callData: empty bytes because we're only sending funds
    );
```
