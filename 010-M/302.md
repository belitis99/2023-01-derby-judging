# blacklisted protocol still accrues rewards

## Summary
A protocol might be blacklisted due to a compromise and its price fluctuating wildly. However, its price is still counted to the total rewards for the game. 

## Vulnerability Detail
During rebalancing each protocol has its prices calculated:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L183-L188
and
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L226-L245

This is later passed to game which counts this to global uncollected rewards:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L384-L398

The issue is that blacklisted protocols still have their price added to rewards.

This can be very dangerous since the reason for blacklisting the protocol might be due to it being compromised and returns a very weird price. Either too high or too low.

This can either cause a lot of derby tokens being burnt through negative rewards or a very high reward taken from other protocols even though the protocol was properly blacklisted.

## Impact
A compromised and correctly blacklisted protocol can cause large changes in price, either resulting in too large rewards or too many `DRB` being burnt as negative awards.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend that price is not updated for blacklisted protocols:

```
If a protocol is "un-blacklisted" it will just fetch a new price and rewards earned/lost while being blacklisted will be counted on the next `rebalancingPeriod`.
