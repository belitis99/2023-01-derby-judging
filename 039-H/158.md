# Reward part of yield is permanently frozen for Providers other than Compound

## Summary

There is a reward part of deposit yield in the most of Derby supported external DeFi protocols.

However, only CompoundProvider has claim() function implemented, for all others it's void, returning false this way, so even if reward tokens were sent out automatically they will not be converted to vault currency and this part of rewards end up permanently frozen on Vault balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

Rewards can't be claimed, as Vault's claimTokens() calls claim() that returns `false` for all providers besides Compound and no swapping of reward tokens is done either way. I.e. even if claiming per se is not needed, and the rewards will be delivered to Vault's balance say on withdrawal, this funds remain permanently frozen.

Rewards can be substantial part of DeFi pool returns (for example, at the moment the whole yield is mostly rewards in Beta Finance).

## Impact

Reward part of yield is lost for Derby depositors for all providers other than Compound.

## Code Snippet

Vault calls claimTokens() on rebalance():

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L135-L141

```solidity
  function rebalance() external nonReentrant {
    require(state == State.RebalanceVault, stateError);
    require(deltaAllocationsReceived, "!Delta allocations");

    rebalancingPeriod++;

    claimTokens();
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L404-L419

```solidity
  function claimTokens() public {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;
      bool claim = controller.claim(vaultNumber, i);
      if (claim) {
        address govToken = controller.getGovToken(vaultNumber, i);
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20(govToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        Swap.swapTokensMulti(
          Swap.SwapInOut(tokenBalance, govToken, address(vaultCurrency)),
          controller.getUniswapParams(),
          false
        );
      }
    }
  }
```

claimTokens() swaps government token rewards from the balance only if controller.claim() returned true for the protocol:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L404-L419

```solidity
  function claimTokens() public {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;
      bool claim = controller.claim(vaultNumber, i);
      if (claim) {
        address govToken = controller.getGovToken(vaultNumber, i);
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20(govToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        Swap.swapTokensMulti(
          Swap.SwapInOut(tokenBalance, govToken, address(vaultCurrency)),
          controller.getUniswapParams(),
          false
        );
      }
    }
  }
```

Controller's claim() returns result of Provider's claim():

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Controller.sol#L57-L70

```solidity
  function claim(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint256 _protocolNumber
  ) external override onlyVault returns (bool) {
    if (claimable[protocolInfo[_vaultNumber][_protocolNumber].LPToken]) {
      return
        IProvider(protocolInfo[_vaultNumber][_protocolNumber].provider).claim(
          protocolInfo[_vaultNumber][_protocolNumber].LPToken,
          msg.sender
        );
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
```

This way if claim() function is void then the claim() return is `false` (which is default bool value) and no swapping is performed in claimTokens() for such a provider even if, for example, rewards were sent out on deposit withdrawal earlier without additional calls.

As there is no swapping and no other treatment of government tokens (the only usage is in claimTokens()), this part of yield is simply frozen on Vault's balance.

Meanwhile, most protocols have additional rewards in place in general, and for some pools even for stablecoin deposits Derby now launches.

Aave has rewards, for example it's available for `Liquid Staking Matic` on Polygon:

https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6&marketName=proto_polygon_v3

AaveProvider's claim is noop:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/AaveProvider.sol#L115

```solidity
  function claim(address _aToken, address _claimer) public override returns (bool) {}
```

Beta has rewards for all the deposits, for example USDC on mainnet:

https://app.betafinance.org/deposit/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48

BetaProvider's claim is noop:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/BetaProvider.sol#L122

```solidity
  function claim(address _bToken, address _claimer) external override returns (bool) {}
```

Idle has rewards, for example USDC Senior Best Yield Vault on mainnet:

https://app.idle.finance/#/earn/best-yield/0x5274891bec421b39d23760c04a6755ecb444797c

IdleProvider's claim is noop:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/IdleProvider.sol#L120

```solidity
  function claim(address _iToken, address _claimer) external override returns (bool) {}
```

TeuFi can have TRU rewards:

https://app.truefi.io/home

TruefiProvider's claim is noop:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/TruefiProvider.sol#L121

```solidity
  function claim(address _tToken, address _claimer) external override returns (bool) {}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing claim() in all the mentioned Providers.

If there is no need to additional claiming call the function still need to return `true` so government tokens that were accumulated earlier be swapped to vault currency and accounted.
