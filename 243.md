# Yield markets secondary reward part of token yield is lost

## Summary

Lending pools and interest rate markets are used to running LP reward programs for liquidity providers. These programs can add various tokens to enhance the regular yield.

Currently such tokens either will remain unclaimed or be stuck permanently on Vault balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

Now only one token can be added for additional reward yield, the protocol government token in Controller.

However, it can be many tokens, and such composite rewards can be among the best yield options.

## Impact

Any reward tokens (besides `protocolGovToken`) send along with withdrawal are permanently frozen on Vault balance.

Such funds are part of the yield and to be attributed to Derby depositors.

## Code Snippet

Only one token, `_govToken`, can be added to a protocol: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Controller.sol#L146-L158

```solidity
  function addProtocol(
    string calldata _name,
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    address _provider,
    address _protocolLPToken,
    address _underlying,
    address _govToken,
    uint256 _uScale
  ) external onlyDao returns (uint256) {
    uint256 protocolNumber = latestProtocolId[_vaultNumber];

    protocolNames[_vaultNumber][protocolNumber] = _name;
    protocolGovToken[_vaultNumber][protocolNumber] = _govToken;
```

It's then one reward token per protocol in claiming:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L404-L419

```solidity
  function claimTokens() public {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;
      bool claim = controller.claim(vaultNumber, i);
      if (claim) {
        address govToken = controller.getGovToken(vaultNumber, i);
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20(govToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        Swap.swapTokensMulti(
          Swap.SwapInOut(tokenBalance, govToken, address(vaultCurrency)),
          controller.getUniswapParams(),
          false
        );
      }
    }
  }
```

For example, Aave can add own token rewards to `Liquid Staking Matic` pool on Polygon, that now have Stader rewards (SD token):

https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6&marketName=proto_polygon_v3

It will be MaticX + SD + Aave and such composite yield cannot be captured by current Derby protocol setup.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider converting `protocolGovToken` to `protocolRewardTokens` array so any composite yield can be configured this way.

Also, consider adding the ability to add/remove elements from `protocolRewardTokens` as any pool can add temporary LP incentives.
