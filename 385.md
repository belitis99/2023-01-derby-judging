# Game.sol : set `homeVault`inside the constructor

## Summary

Game.sol has the `homeVault` which is set the `onlyDao`.

It is not set in the constructor and separate function is used .

This `homeVault` plays crucial role in `redeemNegativeRewards` and `redeemRewards`. there are too many parameters need to be set by the owner/admin/munltisig/dao. By any chance if the `homeVault ` is missed to set, then the rewards would end with dead vault.
