# sendFundsToVault can be called multiple times for the same chainID

## Summary
When `onlyWhenFundsReceived(vaultId)` is true in XChainController, sendFundsToVault can be called repeteadly with the same chain, messing up the accounting and resetting vaultStages for the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
In sendFundsToVault:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L409-L441

There is no check to make sure that the function has not already been called for current chain. So a malicious user can call this function multiple times messing up the cross chain accounting, and incrementing fundsSent for the vault, leading to resetting vaultStages

## Impact
Cross chain accounting is messed up, some funds end up locked because unaccounted for.
