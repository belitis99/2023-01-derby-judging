# receiveAllocations is called twice on XChainController chain

## Summary
When calling `pushAllocations` in `XProvider.sol` receiveAllocationsFromGame ends up being called two times for the chain of `XChainController`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In pushAllocations:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L186

There is a special case when current chain is the chain of `XChainController`. In that case the call:
`IXChainController(xController).receiveAllocationsFromGame(_vaultNumber, _deltas);` can be done directly without using `connext`;

However right after, a message is sent cross chain to call the same function cross chain:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L196

Which means that `receiveAllocationsFromGame` will end up being called two times on `xControllerChain`

## Impact
On that chain deltas for allocation are doubled, which will either overallocate in protocols if the funds are available, or stop the protocol from operating.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Wrap the cross-chain call in `else`;
