# Rebalancing can stuck due to the inability to increase slippage and relayer fee

## Summary
`XProvider` doesn't implement a function to bump the relayer fee and a function to bump the slippage in token transfers. In case a cross-chain messages gets stuck in Connext due to a low relayer fee or a high slippage, vaults rebalancing can be blocked indefinitely. A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability to intentionally trigger sending of a cross-chain message with a low relayer fee or very high slippage.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol integrates with Connext to handle cross-chain interactions. [XProvider](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L14) is a contract that manages interactions between vaults deployed on all supported networks and `XChainController`. `XProtocol` sends messages to Connext via its `xcall` function:
1. [xSend](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L110) calls `IConnext(connext).xcall` to send a cross-chain message;
1. [xTransfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L133) calls `IConnext(connext).xcall` to send tokens between chains.

The `xcall` function takes the [`_delegate` argument](https://docs.connext.network/concepts/how-it-works/transaction-flow):
> An address on destination domain that has rights to update slippage tolerance, retry transactions, or revert back to origin in the event that a transaction fails at the destination.

A delegate can call the `forceUpdateSlippage` function [to increase the slippage tolerance of a failed token transfer](https://docs.connext.network/concepts/how-it-works/transaction-flow) and the `bumpTransfer` function to [increase the relayer fee of a transaction failed due to increased gas cost](https://docs.connext.network/concepts/how-it-works/transaction-flow). However, neither of the contracts of the project allows to call the functions.

The `xSend` and `xTransfer` functions of `XProvider` are internal functions that are called from other functions of the contracts. Any public function that calls `xSend` or `xTransfer` can either be called by: [the Game](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L189), [a vault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L220), or [the controller](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L282). However, neither of these contracts allows to call `forceUpdateSlippage` or `bumpTransfer`.

Since all the functions that constitute the rebalancing process (e.g. [pushAllocationsToController](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L424), (pushAllocationsToVaults)[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L465], etc.) are public and not restricted, a malicious actor can call any of them and set the relayer fee to a very low value (i.e. send a small amount of the native call along the call). The message call will end up in the Connext queue and will stay there indefinitely because the relayer fee will be much smaller than the gas cost on the destination chain. And since all functions involved in rebalancing are conditioned (they can be called only in certain conditions) re-triggering some of them may be not possible, thus leading to a blocked rebalancing.
## Impact
Any cross-chain message can be intentionally left stuck in Connext due to a low relayer fee or a high slippage. Here is an example of functions that can be affected and cannot be re-triggered:
1. [pushAllocationsToController](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L424) starts a rebalancing of vaults. The function can be execute after `rebalanceInterval` seconds have passed since the last rebalance. The function also requires that the vaults to be rebalanced [are not currently being rebalanced](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L432).
1. The function can be execute by anyone as soon as above conditions are met.
1. The function is payable: the caller must send some amount of the native coin (e.g. ETH), which will be used to pay th relayer fee. The functions calls [XProvider.pushAllocations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L186), which calls `xSend`, in which relayer fee is [set to `msg.value`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L113-L115).
1. If the caller of the function provides no relayer fee or a small relayer fee, the function will change the state of the contract, will send the cross chain message, however the message will end up stuck in Connext due to the low relayer fee. As a result, `pushAllocationsToController` cannot be called again until `rebalanceInterval` have passed, but rebalancing cannot proceed as well due to the cross-chain message not have been processed by the `XChainController`.

A similar scenario can happen with any other non-restricted function that triggers a cross chain message via `XProvider`. For example, a cross-chain token transfer can get stuck if [the slippage specified during the call that triggered the message](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L318) turned out to be too big: the router will try to swap tokens on the destination chain and will receive less tokens than set by the slippage parameter. Such transfer will [revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L318), and calling `forceUpdateSlippage` will be required to update the slippage and push the transfer through.
## Code Snippet
1. In `xSend`, when calling `IConnext.xcall`, `_delegate` is set to `msg.sender`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L119
1. In `xTransfer`, when calling `IConnext.xcall`, `_delegate` is also set to `msg.sender`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L156
1. `Game`, `XChainController`, and `MainVault` don't implement functions that call Connext's `forceUpdateSlippage` or `bumpTransfer` to update slippage or increase relayer fee:

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Short term, consider setting the guardian's address as the `_delegate` argument value in the calls to `IConnext.xcall`. However, be aware that, while this will allow the guardian to push a stuck message through, as long as all the functions that make `XProvider` send cross-chain message remain non-restricted, any user will be able to make it send a message with a low relayer fee or a zero slippage tolerance, causing the massage to get stuck in Connext.

Long term, consider making all the functions that send a cross-chain message via `XProvider` restricted, so that they could be called only by the guardian or a keeper.
