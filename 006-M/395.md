# Unsafe ERC20.transfer()

## Summary

The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Vulnerability Detail

Using unsafe ERC20 methods can revert the transaction for certain tokens.

## Impact

Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer and tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.

```solidity
574: IERC20(_token).transfer(xController, balance);
583: IERC20(_token).transfer(vault, balance);
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
