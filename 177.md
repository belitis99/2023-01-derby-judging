# No access control and input validation in `unlockTokensFromBasket` function can lead to unauthorized token transfers and reentrancy attacks.

## Summary
`unlockTokensFromBasket()` function in the smart contract contains a vulnerability due to the lack of access control and input validation checks, which can lead to unauthorized token transfers and reentrancy attacks. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to bypass security controls and transfer tokens to unauthorized accounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lies in the `unlockTokensFromBasket` function of the smart contract, which is responsible for unlocking tokens allocated to the user from the specified basket.

The issue is that this function lacks access control and input validation checks, which can lead to unauthorized token transfers and reentrancy attacks.

To elaborate further, there is no check in place to ensure that the caller of this function is authorized to unlock tokens from the specified basket. An attacker could potentially call this function and unlock tokens that do not belong to them. Additionally, the function takes in two parameters `_basketId and _unlockedTokenAmount`, which are not validated for their correctness, an attacker could pass in invalid values, causing the function to malfunction and leading to potential loss of funds.

Furthermore, the function makes a call to the `redeemNegativeRewards` function, which is also not protected by access control. If an attacker is able to call this function, they could potentially trigger a reentrancy attack by recursively calling back into the `unlockTokensFromBasket` function.

## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized token transfers, resulting in financial loss for the token holders. An attacker can use the vulnerability to transfer tokens to unauthorized accounts they control.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `unlockTokensFromBasket()` function should only be accessible to authorized accounts. Input validation checks should be added to ensure that the input parameters are valid and within the expected range. 
`require` statement should be used to ensure that the function is only executed if the conditions are met. 
The use of the "SafeMath" library should also be considered to prevent integer overflow and underflow.
