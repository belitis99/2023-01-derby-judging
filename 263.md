# Impossible to pull funds from providers

## Summary
If there is shortage of collateral in Vault then contract has logic to pull fund from providers. Vault has a list of providers and it iterate over the list to perform the withdraw. It is possible to break out of the loop which result in not going to next provider from list and hence not being able to pull enough fund to satisfy shortage.

## Vulnerability Detail
This issue will happen if
- provider has non-zero allocation 
- and has `balanceUnderlying()` less than `minimumPull`
- and `shortage` is greater than `balanceUnderlying()` 

then it will break for loop and never advance to next provider. 

```solidity
    uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(i);
    uint256 amountToWithdraw = shortage > balanceProtocol ? balanceProtocol : shortage;
        savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;
        if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) break;
```

## Impact
`rebalance()` will not be able to pull fund from provider to satisfy collateral shortage in Vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider modifying existing `if` condition which breaks out of loop and add another condition to handle small `balanceUnderlying`
```solidity
      uint256 shortage = _value - vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this));
      if (shortage < minimumPull) break;
      uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(i);
      if(balanceProtocol < minimumPull) continue;
```
