# Claim not called before blacklisting

## Summary
It was observed that `claimTokens` function is not called before blacklisting a protocol. This results in loss of extra token which would have resulted during the harvesting

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe the `blacklistProtocol` function

```solidity
function blacklistProtocol(uint256 _protocolNum) external onlyGuardian {
    uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(_protocolNum);
    currentAllocations[_protocolNum] = 0;
    controller.setProtocolBlacklist(vaultNumber, _protocolNum);
    savedTotalUnderlying -= balanceProtocol;
    withdrawFromProtocol(_protocolNum, balanceProtocol);
  }
```

2. Observe that this is changing the currentAllocations of the protocol to 0
3. Lets see the `claimTokens` function

```solidity
function claimTokens() public {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;
      bool claim = controller.claim(vaultNumber, i);
      ...
      }
    }
  }
```

4. As we can see if current allocation is 0 then claim will not be made
5. If claim was made before blacklisting then the extra harvest tokens would have been claimed

## Impact
The extra token which would have resulted in the claim would be lost since blacklisting turns allocation to 0

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update `blacklistProtocol` function to first harvest the extra tokens by calling the `claimTokens` function
