# Player can prevent rebalancing from completing by allocating to blacklisted protocols.

## Summary
When a player allocates to blacklisted protocols, the vault won't be able complete rebalancing.

## Vulnerability Detail
Only Vault.sol refers to the protocol blacklist - the game, the xController, and the xProvider does not check if a protocol is blacklisted. You can verify this with a quick grep.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L318
So, there's nothing stopping a player from allocating to a blacklisted protocol.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L397
However, vault requires that the protocol isn't blacklisted when setting the delta allocations.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L354
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L357
This means that if a player has allocated to a blacklisted protocol, deltaAllocationsReceived won't be true.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L137
This prevents rebalance from succeeding. Therefore, the vault will be stuck in the RebalanceVault state.

## Impact
This vulnerability prevents deposits and withdrawals since they can only happen when the vault is idle. Furthermore, the allocations in the protocols will be incorrect since rebalance doesn't finish. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L476
Lastly, isXChainRebalancing will be stuck as true (since pushProtocolAllocationsToVault fails).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L324
This prevents players from rebalancing their basket for this vault.

I understand that there are guardian functions that can overwrite states and protocol allocations, which is why I'm setting the severity as medium. However, I still think this is a vulnerability because it's trivial for players to trigger it (whether maliciously or accidentally). And when it's triggered, the vault won't function properly until a guardian manually resolves the issue.

## Recommendation
The game should prevent player from allocating to blacklisted protocols. It may be worth adding some checks in the xProvider and xController as well.
