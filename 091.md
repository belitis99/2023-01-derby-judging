# Vault.pullFunds decreases `savedTotalUnderlying` param incorrectly sometimes

## Summary
Vault.pullFunds decreases `savedTotalUnderlying` param incorrectly in case when `amountToWithdraw` was not received from 1 provider. Because of that underlying amount of vault is calculated incorrectly and rebalancing is not accurate.
## Vulnerability Detail
`Vault.pullFunds` function is designed to make balance of Vault in vaultCurrency to be equal to `_value` param. To do that function calculates `shortage` and then trying to withdraw this shortage from providers one by one.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L111-L127
```solidity
  function pullFunds(uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;


      uint256 shortage = _value - vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this));
      uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(i);


      uint256 amountToWithdraw = shortage > balanceProtocol ? balanceProtocol : shortage;
      savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;


      if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) break;
      withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw);


      if (_value <= vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this))) break;
    }
  }
```

What is interesting is that function decreases `savedTotalUnderlying` variable with `amountToWithdraw`, before withdraw. But it's possible, that provider doesn't have all needed amount(`amountToWithdraw`), so function will go to next cycle of loop and will try to withdraw shortage from another provider. Also in case if `amountToWithdraw < minimumPull` then this amount is also not withdrawn from provider, but `savedTotalUnderlying` is decreased.
For example if shortage is 1K and only last provider has this 1K and we have 5 providers(4 of them are empty for simplicity or have very small amount), then `savedTotalUnderlying` will be decreased by 5K instead of 1K.
Because of that `savedTotalUnderlying` is incorrectly decreased.
This can lead to unpredicted state, in case if `savedTotalUnderlying` is not big enough, so function will revert with underflow error.

Also, because `savedTotalUnderlying` is updated incorrectly, then rebalancing [will be not accurate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L144-L145), as underlying amount will be [calculated incorrectly](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L158-L164).

I believe this is high severity as the problems will happen, once first provider of protocol doesn't have enough funds to withdraw shortage. 
## Impact
Depending on the situation rebalancing can revert or rebalancing can become not accurate.
