# Whitelist only allows addition, not removal

## Summary
Whitelist only allows addition, not removal
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Controller` and `MainVault` contracts, only adding to the whitelist is allowed. Once added, it cannot be removed, regardless of what happens. The world of cryptocurrencies is unpredictable and even stablecoins can become unpegged. For example, with USDC, it is recommended that the whitelist can also be removed.

```solidity
// derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Controller.sol:

175    function addVault(address _vault) external onlyDao {
176:     vaultWhitelist[_vault] = true;
177    }

// derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol:

472    function addToWhitelist(address _address) external onlyGuardian {
473:     whitelist[_address] = true;
474    }
```
A feature similar to that in the XProvider contract should be designed:
```solidity
// derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol:

538    function toggleVaultWhitelist(address _vault) external onlyDao {
539:     vaultWhitelist[_vault] = !vaultWhitelist[_vault];
```
