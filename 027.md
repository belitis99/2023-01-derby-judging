# Risk free rewards steal for malicious basket nfts holder

## Summary
A malicious basket owner can do an allocation to set `lastRebalancingPeriod` to current period + 1, and reset it entirely to zero. Later they can take a substantial share of the rewards by reallocating a lot of derby tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
In addToRewards:

the whole logic is bypassed when `baskets[_basketId].nrOfAllocatedTokens == 0` which means that a user can conduct the following scenario:

- allocate amounts [X, X, X] by depositing 3X derby tokens
- deallocate amounts by allocating [-X, -X, -X], at this point the state is the same since before the allocation, only the lastRebalancingPeriod is set by addToRewards.
- when rewards have accrued, user can allocate huge amounts [100X, 100X, 100X] and since the logic in addToRewards is bypassed, because `nrOfAllocatedTokens == 0`, the user reaps an enormous part of the rewards.

## Impact
By doing this on multiple baskets, a user can extract an arbitrary amount of tokens from the protocol.

## Recommendation
Still set `lastRebalancingPeriod` even if `baskets[_basketId].nrOfAllocatedTokens == 0`
