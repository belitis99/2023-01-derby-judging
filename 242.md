# The `totalSupply` of the DerbyToken will be always `0` due to lack of input validation to check whether or not the `_totalSupply` would be `0`.

## Summary
Due to lack of input validation to check whether or not the `_totalSupply` would be `0`, the owner (deployer) may accidentally assign `0` into the `_totalSupply` parameter within the DerbyToken#`constructor()`.

This lead to a bad situation that the `totalSupply` of the DerbyToken will be always `0` unless the owner re-deploy the DerbyToken.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the DerbyToken#`constructor()`,
the `_totalSupply` would be assigned as a parameter and then it would be used as the argument value of the `_mint()` like this:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/DerbyToken.sol#L13
```solidity
contract DerbyToken is ERC20 {
  constructor(
    string memory _name,
    string memory _symbol,
    uint256 _totalSupply  /// @audit 
  ) ERC20(_name, _symbol) {
    _mint(msg.sender, _totalSupply);  /// @audit 
  }
}
```

However, there is no input validation to check whether or not the `_totalSupply` would be `0`.
If the owner (deployer) accidentally assign `0` into the `_totalSupply` parameter within the DerbyToken#`constructor()`,  the `totalSupply` of the DerbyToken will be always `0`. 

In addition to that, the DerbyToken would not be the upgradable token. 
Thus, unless the owner re-deploy the DerbyToken, the `totalSupply` of the DerbyToken will be always `0`. 

## Impact
This lead to a bad situation that the `totalSupply` of the DerbyToken will be always `0`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a input validation to the DerbyToken#`constructor()` in order to check whether or not the `_totalSupply` would be `0` like this:
```solidity
contract DerbyToken is ERC20 {
  constructor(
    string memory _name,
    string memory _symbol,
    uint256 _totalSupply  
  ) ERC20(_name, _symbol) {
+   require(_totalSupply != 0, "totalSupply must be more than 0");
    _mint(msg.sender, _totalSupply);
  }
}
```
