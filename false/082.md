# YearnProvider may not work for some tokens.

## Summary
Underlying token transfers in YearnProvider are undergoing strict checks for the transferred amount which is either useless or entirely blocking, depending on the token.
## Vulnerability Detail
deposit() and withdraw() are checking that the Underlying token transfer results in the exact token amount transferred as was requested.
(also the way the check is written is pretty awkward, wrong, and the error message is wrong.)
If the token in question does have some fees or whatever could change the value, the provider will never work for that token.

This identical issue is reported separately for every provider.
## Impact
The provider may not work at all for some tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If some token can subtract fees, let it pass and adjust the returned value accordingly. If all the tokens are known to transfer with the expected value, then remove the check altogether.
