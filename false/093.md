# DAO change should happen in two steps

## Summary

Most important  functions acan be called only by DAO adress. And now you need just one step to chanhe it.

## Vulnerability Detail

In case of misclicking or using copy-paste options there is a possibility to change dao address to invalid address, as well as 0 address.

## Impact

Contracts that use dao call can be stucked and the protocol will be unavailable to work with.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add two step of changing dao address. For example, it can be function to offer dao address, and the second one to accept it. Better to do it with a time delay period.
