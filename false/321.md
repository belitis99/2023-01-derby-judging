# Possible division by zero error in `transferFunds`

## Summary

In `MainVault.sol` we have function `transferFunds()`. 
```solidity
function transferFunds(address _receiver, uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 govFee = (_value * governanceFee) / 10_000; 

    vaultCurrency.safeTransfer(getDao(), govFee);
    vaultCurrency.safeTransfer(_receiver, _value - govFee);
  }
```
This function is used in `withdrawAllowance()` and `withdraw()`.
It is possible to get division by zero error because `governanceFee` is initially equal to 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

When we deploy `MainVault.sol` we set `governanceFee = 0`.  The way we can change `governanceFee` is through the `setGovernanceFee()` function.
```solidity
function setGovernanceFee(uint16 _fee) external onlyGuardian {
    governanceFee = _fee;
  }
```
This function is called by Guardian and if he forgets or does not change `governanceFee` we will get division by zero error in `transferFunds`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In my opinion it is better to set some initial fee other than zero in the constructor.
