# Undefined data variable is found

## Summary


Vault.sol used the storePriceAndRewards() which has the following line

    int256 totalAllocatedTokensRounded = totalAllocatedTokens / 1E18;

here, we can see that 1E18 is used instead of 1e18.

I serached for 1E18, but nowhere found in solidity document.
