# a first depositor can inflate share prices

## Summary
Before step 2, a user can inflate the share price by doing a manual transfer of funds to the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
If there aren't any depositors during the first cycle. A first depositor can brake the share price by acquiring 1 wei of shares in the vault. Then doing a manual transfer of just before step 2 is started. Since step 2, `pushTotalUnderlyingToController` can be started by anyone this can be done in the same tx.

## Impact
It is possible to inflate the share price benefiting early depositors. Since this is requiring that none have deposited into the vault I'm submitting this as medium since the likelyhood of this happening is low.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend the protocol themselves deposit `10 USDC` into each vault at deploy to mitigate this. This would increase the cost of this attack.
