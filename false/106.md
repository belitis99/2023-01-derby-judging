# Game.setNegativeRewardFactor doesn't check that factor is less than 100

## Summary
Game.setNegativeRewardFactor doesn't check that factor is less than 100
## Vulnerability Detail
`Game.setNegativeRewardFactor` function sets new `negativeRewardFactor` variable.
There is no any check there, that it less than 100%. Actually, through the all code base there are no checks for input, but in case of this function i think it should be as docs says, that `negativeRewardFactor` should be not 100.

> NRF: Negative Reward Factor (between 0 and 1), not 100% of the negative rewards have to be slashed.
## Impact
`negativeRewardFactor` can be set to 100%, however docs say, that it shouldn't.
