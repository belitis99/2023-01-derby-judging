# on shortage vault will not pull all the available funds

## Summary

On shortage `Vault#pullFunds` method should pull assets from all underlying protocols until the desired value is less then the vault balance. But in the current implementation it can stop pulling prematurely.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `Vault#pullFunds` is withdrawing from underlying protocols it stops when reaches an amount to withdraw that is lower then the minimum pull value.

Note: the minimum pull value represented as `minimumPull` non immutable variable is once set in the constructor but has no method to be reset to another value in the case it nets to be reset.

## Impact

By not keeping withdrawing from all the underlying vault protocols a vault can't pull funds even if it has enough underlying balance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of just break from the withdrawing loop skip the current and continue to the next vault protocol

```diff
  function pullFunds(uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;


      uint256 shortage = _value - vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this));
      uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(i);


      uint256 amountToWithdraw = shortage > balanceProtocol ? balanceProtocol : shortage;
      savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;


-     if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) break;
+     if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) continue; 
 
      withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw);

      if (_value <= vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this))) break;
    }
  }
```
