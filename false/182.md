# "TokenTimelock" contract is the manipulation of `block.timestamp` function, leading to incorrect time calculations.

## Summary
`TokenTimelock` contract uses the `block.timestamp` function to calculate the number of months that have passed since the start of the contract, However, this function can be manipulated by miners to slightly alter the timestamp value, leading to incorrect calculations. An attacker could use this vulnerability to prematurely release tokens from the `TokenTimelock` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
uint256 timePassed = block.timestamp - startTimestamp;
```

Where the "block.timestamp" is used to calculate the time passed since the start of the contract, it can be manipulated by miners to slightly alter the timestamp value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

The vulnerability is related to the use of `block.timestamp` as the source of time calculation, as mentioned earlier, miners can manipulate the `block.timestamp` to some extent and lead to incorrect calculations.

In the `TokenTimelock` contract, the `claimableTokens` function calculates the number of tokens that can be claimed by the beneficiary based on the time that has passed since the start of the contract, the calculation of `monthsPassed` uses the `block.timestamp` value to determine the number of months passed, this value can be manipulated by miners to give an incorrect value, leading to wrong calculations and resulting in releasing tokens earlier than intended.

## Impact
If an attacker manipulates the block.timestamp function, they could prematurely release tokens from the `TokenTimelock` contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace the usage of `block.timestamp` with a more secure and tamper-resistant source of time, One approach could be to use an external oracle service that provides a trusted timestamp, such as NIST's Internet Time Service or Chainlink's oracle network.
