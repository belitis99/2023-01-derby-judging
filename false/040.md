# Missing admin input sanitization

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Missing maximum value check that is set by the contract owner. This vulnerability can allow the contract owner to withdraw/earn more funds than what was intended or expected, resulting in a loss of funds for investors.

## Impact
 
## Code Snippet

```solidity
  /// @notice See setXChainAllocationInt below
  function setXChainAllocation(
    uint256 _amountToSend,
    uint256 _exchangeRate,
    bool _receivingFunds
  ) external onlyXProvider {
    require(state == State.PushedUnderlying, stateError);
    setXChainAllocationInt(_amountToSend, _exchangeRate, _receivingFunds); //@audit no Max value restriction
  }

 
  function setXChainAllocationInt(
    uint256 _amountToSend,
    uint256 _exchangeRate,
    bool _receivingFunds
  ) internal {
    amountToSendXChain = _amountToSend;
    exchangeRate = _exchangeRate;   //@audit no Max value restriction

    if (_amountToSend == 0 && !_receivingFunds) settleReservedFunds();
    else if (_amountToSend == 0 && _receivingFunds) state = State.WaitingForFunds;
    else state = State.SendingFundsXChain;
  }

```solidity
  function setRebalanceInterval(uint256 _timestampInternal) external onlyGuardian {
    rebalanceInterval = _timestampInternal;  //@audit no Max value restriction
  }
  /// @notice Set the marginScale, the threshold used for deposits and withdrawals.
  /// @notice If the threshold is not met the deposit/ withdrawal is not executed.
  /// @dev Take into account the uScale (scale of the underlying).
  /// @param _marginScale Value at which to set the marginScale.
  function setMarginScale(int256 _marginScale) external onlyGuardian {
    marginScale = _marginScale;  //@audit no Max value restriction
  }

```solidity
  /// @notice Setter for threshold at which user tokens will be sold / burned
  /// @param _threshold treshold in vaultCurrency e.g USDC, must be negative
  function setNegativeRewardThreshold(int256 _threshold) external onlyDao {
    negativeRewardThreshold = _threshold;  //@audit no Max value restriction
  }

  /// @notice Setter for negativeRewardFactor

    negativeRewardFactor = _factor;  //@audit no Max value restriction

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent this vulnerability, it's important to include a maximum value check in the contract code.
