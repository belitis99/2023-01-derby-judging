# missing calculation in the function getprice.

## Summary
the function price in the vault contract is intended to calculate the price for underlying protocol however there is no calculation of it.

## Vulnerability Detail
the price function only checks the protocolinfo then returns the protocolprice per LP token without calculating it. to get the current price which is used to calculate the price difference  the function getprice is called and since it returns incorrect value the price difference will be incorrect.the function _storepriceandrewards_  uses the price difference to calculate the nominator which is further used to calculate the rewardperlockedtoken .  this leads to wrong price and rewards being stored before rebalancing is done.
## Impact
Game players will be rewarded incorrect rewards since wrong price and rewards are stored in the function _storepriceandrewards_.


## Code Snippet
 /// @notice Get price for underlying protocol
  /// @param _protocolNum Protocol number linked to an underlying protocol e.g compound_usdc_01
  /// @return protocolPrice Price per lp token
  function price(uint256 _protocolNum) public view returns (uint256) {
    IController.ProtocolInfoS memory protocol = controller.getProtocolInfo(
      vaultNumber,
      _protocolNum
    );
    return IProvider(protocol.provider).exchangeRate(protocol.LPToken);
  }
