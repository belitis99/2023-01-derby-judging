# Exchange Rate of CompoundProvider is wrongly calculated.

## Summary

In CompoundProvider contract, when considering the exchange rate between cTokens and uTokens in a given Compound pool, the poolâ€™s exchangeRateStored function is used rather than its exchangeRateCurrent function. The result is that the exchange rate used is out of date, and relies on parties interacting with the Compound pool incredibly regularly. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `exchangeRate` in contract `CompoundProvider` the function calculates the rate as follows:

```solidity
function exchangeRate(address _cToken) public view override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 _price = ICToken(_cToken).exchangeRateStored();
    return _price;
  }
```

This value can be manipulated using flash borrows, as the `exchangeRateStored` is calculated based on the `totalBorrows` of `CToken`, which can be artificially increased by a large amount of borrow operated on Compound.

## Impact

This might lead to fund loss depending on the liquidity present in the vault as the price will return different value than it should.

## Recommendation

Use `exchangeRateCurrent` instead of `exchangeRateStored`.
