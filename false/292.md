# Lack of proper access control for the claim function

## Summary
`claim()` function is guarded with the `onlyVault` modifier, 
which restricts access to only those addresses that have been added to the `vaultWhitelist ` `mapping` using the `addVault()`  function. 
However, anyone who can call the `addVault() ` function and add their address to the `mapping`, effectively grants themselves access to the `claim()` function. 

For example, 
let's say, an attacker deploys a contract that calls the `addVault()` function with their own address as the parameter. 
They can then call  `claim()` function from their deployed contract and withdraw tokens from the contract's balance, 
even if they are not actually a trusted vault. This can result in a loss of funds for the contract owner.

illustration of how an unauthorized user could add their address to  `vaultWhitelist` mapping and gain access to the `claim() `function,

Step 1 , Write and deploy a cantract as `Vault{}`
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Vault {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bool) public vaultWhitelist;
    
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can call this function.");
        _;
    }
    
    modifier onlyVault() {
        require(vaultWhitelist[msg.sender], "Only whitelisted vaults can call this function.");
        _;
    }
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function addVault(address _vault) public onlyOwner {
        vaultWhitelist[_vault] = true;
    }
    
    function claim() public onlyVault {
        // Only whitelisted vaults can call this function
        // Claim logic here
    }
}
```
Step 2: An unauthorized user deploys the contract and becomes its owner,
```solidity
Vault contract = new Vault();
```
Step 3, The unauthorized user calls  `addVault() `function and adds their address to the `vaultWhitelist` mapping,
```solidity
contract.addVault(msg.sender);
```
Step 3, The unauthorized user can now call the `claim()` function, which was previously restricted to only whitelisted vaults.
```solidity
contract.claim();
```
By adding their address to  `vaultWhitelist` mapping, the unauthorized user has gained access to the `claim() ` function.

## Impact
It can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive functions and data, such as the ability to claim rewards , this can also result in financial loss for users and can undermine the trust in the contract . 

 If this contract is used to manage funds or provide financial services, the lack of proper access control can violate legal requirements, such as know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. 

This may result in legal penalties and damage to the reputation of the platform and the individuals involved.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To solve this, we can use **OpenZeppelin Access Control library**, which provides a standardized implementation of access control .

Using this library, we can define a "VaultManager" role and assign the permission to add or remove addresses from the vault whitelist .
