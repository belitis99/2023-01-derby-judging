# Partial deltaAllocations can unlock user funds without updating allocations

## Summary
In `Game.sol` a user can update his allocations for a protocol by passing an array indexed by [chains][protocols]. If the user provides only allocation for first chains or an empty array, they can unlock part/whole funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
As seen in `rebalanceBasket`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L318-L333

the length of `int256[][] memory _deltaAllocations` is not checked.
A user can input an empty array, and in `settleDeltaAllocations`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L342-L364

since the array is empty, returned `totalDelta` is zero.
which means that all the capital is unlocked for the user in `lockUnlockTokens`, whereas the allocations for the basket stay the same.

## Impact
- Protocol can be heavily undercollateralized in terms of derby tokens compared to allocated underlyings
- Users can influence allocations for the whole protocol with very little funds in terms of derby tokens by reusing them using this tactic

## Recommendation
Check the length of the array is equal to number of chains.
