# Game players won't be able to ` redeemRewardsGame()`

## Summary
The modifier [onlyWhenVaultIsOn()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L75-L79) will revert in case the vault is off.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vault X is in the same chain/L with `game.sol`
In the case of vault X having `zero` allocations or having only 1 protocol on it which gets blacklisted over time.

Now, vault X is off and the Game players won't be able to [redeemRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L545-L553) ==> [redeemRewardsGame()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L194-L204)
## Impact
The Game players won't be able to redeem rewards
The baskets will be updated with the wrong value

```diff
  function redeemRewardsGame(
    uint256 _value,
    address _user
- ) external onlyGame nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn {
+ ) external onlyGame nonReentrant onlyWhenIdle {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_user];
    require(user.rewardAllowance == 0, allowanceError);

    user.rewardAllowance = _value;
    user.rewardRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
    totalWithdrawalRequests += _value;
  }
```
