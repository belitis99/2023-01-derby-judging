# Deposited funds are locked in inactive vaults

## Summary
Users cannot request withdrawal of their funds from inactive vaults: if a vault receives 0 allocations from gamers, only previous withdrawal requests can be process and new requests cannot be made.
## Vulnerability Detail
During rebalancing, if a vault receives 0 allocations from gamers, [it becomes inactive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L229-L235). `MainVault` doesn't allow calling these functions on an inactive vault:
1. [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L106-L109), which makes sense because the vault doesn't generate yield and users shouldn't be allowed to deposit funds in such vaults;
1. [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L131-L135), which also makes sense because the vault holds no funds, so immediate withdrawals are not possible;
1. [withdrawalRequest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L149-L151), which seems wrong because this doesn't allow users to withdraw funds after next rebalancing.

Since inactive vaults don't receive funds during rebalancing, it expected that immediate withdrawals via the `withdraw` function are disabled (inactive vaults don't hold funds, thus funds cannot be withdrawn immediately). However, disallowing `withdrawalRequest` seems like a mistake: users who have deposited their funds into an inactive vault and who are still holding shares of the vault might decide, after seeing that the vault haven't received allocations during last rebalancing (e.g. protocols on other networks might generate higher yields and gamers might want to direct all allocations to those protocols), to withdraw their funds. `withdrawalRequest` allows them to request withdrawal after next rebalancing, which is a crucial feature of the protocol.
## Impact
In the worst case scenario, user funds can be locked in an inactive vault for a prolonged period of time. E.g. if the vault is deployed in a network where yield generating protocols produce lower APY than protocols on other networks. In this scenario, gamers will be willing to allocate to more profitable protocols, but depositors of the inactive vault will be forced to keep their funds locked in the vault until on-chain conditions change (which are not controlled by users, e.g. users cannot force a protocol to have a higher APY).
## Code Snippet
1. When `XChainController` receives allocations, it disables vault that have 0 allocations and that haven't received new allocations:

1. Withdrawals cannot be requested in inactive vaults due to the `onlyWhenVaultIsOn` modifier:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L149-L151
1. `withdrawAllowance` can only withdraw funds when there's a withdrawal request:

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider allowing users call `withdrawalRequest` to request withdrawal in inactive vault. During rebalancing, inactive vaults with positive `withdrawalRequest` should receive enough funds for all requests to be processed.
