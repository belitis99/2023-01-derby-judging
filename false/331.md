# withdrawalRequest() maybe lost funds in the first period

## Summary
no limit cannot request when rebalancingPeriod == 0 , user maybe lost funds

## Vulnerability Detail
`withdrawalRequest()` for withdrawal request for when the vault doesn't have enough funds available
The code is as follows:
```solidity
  function withdrawalRequest(
    uint256 _amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request"); //<------- period ==0 is ok

    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);

    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod; //<--------if rebalancingPeriod==0, can request again
    totalWithdrawalRequests += value;
  }
```
There is a problem here
the period starts at 0
if the current is in the first period (rebalancingPeriod ==0), multiple requests will be overwritten by subsequent ones
Example:
assume
rebalancingPeriod = 0

1.alice call withdrawalRequest(_amount = 100):
userInfo[alice].withdrawalAllowance = 100
totalWithdrawalRequests = 100

2.alice call withdrawalRequest(_amount = 50) again:
userInfo[alice].withdrawalAllowance = 50
totalWithdrawalRequests = 150

## Recommendation
```solidity
  function withdrawalRequest(
    uint256 _amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
+   require(rebalancingPeriod!=0,"can't request in first period");
    require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");

    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);

    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
    totalWithdrawalRequests += value;
  }
```
