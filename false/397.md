# savedTotalUnderlying may be unexpectedly reduced

## Summary
The total underlying of the vault may be unexpectedly reduced
## Vulnerability Detail

Withdrawing the underlying protocol may not be successful when the vault is short of exiting the protocol, but the total underlying in the vault may unexpectedly decrease

## Impact

if `amountToWithdraw < minimumPull`, It will jump out of the current loop. At this time, no bottom layer is extracted, but savedTotalUnderlying will be reduced. [Vault.sol#L111-L127](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L111-L127)

```solidity
    uint256 shortage = _value - vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(i);

    uint256 amountToWithdraw = shortage > balanceProtocol ? balanceProtocol : shortage;
    savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;

    if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) break;
    withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw);
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
  function pullFunds(uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;

      uint256 shortage = _value - vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this));
      uint256 balanceProtocol = balanceUnderlying(i);

      uint256 amountToWithdraw = shortage > balanceProtocol ? balanceProtocol : shortage;
-     savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;

      if (amountToWithdraw < minimumPull) break;
      withdrawFromProtocol(i, amountToWithdraw);
+     savedTotalUnderlying -= amountToWithdraw;

      if (_value <= vaultCurrency.balanceOf(address(this))) break;
    }
  }
