# If user is added to the USDC blacklist, then his assets will be frozen in the protocol

## Summary

If user is added to the USDC blacklist, then user's assets will be frozen in the protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
The ```withdrawAllowance()``` is used to withdraw the allowance the user requested on the last rebalancing period. The protocol will send the user funds. According to the document, USDC is the main currency that should be deposited. If user is added to the USDC blacklist(e.g by doing something malicious with that address,etc.), then ```withdrawAllowance()``` will not work for that user , then user's assets will be frozen in the protocol.

```solidity
function withdrawAllowance() external nonReentrant onlyWhenIdle returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalAllowance > 0, allowanceError);
    require(rebalancingPeriod > user.withdrawalRequestPeriod, "Funds not arrived");

    value = user.withdrawalAllowance;
    value = checkForBalance(value);

    reservedFunds -= value;
    delete user.withdrawalAllowance;
    delete user.withdrawalRequestPeriod;

    transferFunds(msg.sender, value);
  }
```

## Impact
If user is added to the USDC blacklist, then user's assets will be frozen in the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
like ```withdraw()``` function, add a parameter ```_receiver```
```solidity
function withdrawAllowance(address _receiver) external nonReentrant onlyWhenIdle returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalAllowance > 0, allowanceError);
```
