# Wrong calculation of `balanceBefore` and `balanceAfter` in deposit method

## Summary
Deposit method calculate net amount transferred from user.  It use `reservedFunds` also in consideration when calculating `balanceBefore` and `balanceAfter` but it is not actually require.

```solidity
    uint256 balanceBefore = getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;
    vaultCurrency.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    uint256 balanceAfter = getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;
    uint256 amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
```

## Vulnerability Detail
Deposit may fail when `reservedFunds` is greater than `getVaultBalance()`

## Impact
Deposit may fail when `reservedFunds` is greater than `getVaultBalance()`

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    uint256 balanceBefore = getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;
    vaultCurrency.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    uint256 balanceAfter = getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;
    uint256 amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use below code. This is correct way of finding net amount transfer by depositor
```solidity
    uint256 balanceBefore = getVaultBalance();
    vaultCurrency.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    uint256 balanceAfter = getVaultBalance();
    uint256 amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
```
