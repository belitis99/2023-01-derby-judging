# cross chain call failure is not handled.

## Summary
All the cross chain transaction is done in `XProvider.sol` .
The transactions, xSend, xTransfer, pushFeedbackToXController, pushProtocolAllocationsToVault , pushRewardsToGame, are calling the xcall code as shown below,

     IConnext(connext).xcall{value: relayerFee}(
      _destinationDomain, // _destination: Domain ID of the destination chain
      target, // _to: address of the target contract
      address(0), // _asset: use address zero for 0-value transfers
      msg.sender, // _delegate: address that can revert or forceLocal on destination
      0, // _amount: 0 because no funds are being transferred
      0, // _slippage: can be anything between 0-10000 because no funds are being transferred
      _callData // _callData: the encoded calldata to send
    );

There no checks for whether the transaction is succeeded or not.
The cause of the failure across due to multiple reason like out of gas, temporary unavailable of the chain functionality and so.

Check for mock calling, it is nor clear how it is handling the failure cases,

     function xcall(
    uint32 _destination,
    address _to,
    address _asset,
    address _delegate,
    uint256 _amount,
    uint256 _slippage,
    bytes calldata _callData
  ) external payable returns (bytes32) {
    if (_asset != address(0)) IERC20(_asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, _to, _amount);
    else
      IXReceiver(_to).xReceive(
        bytes32(""),
        0,
        address(0),
        msg.sender,
        domainLookup[msg.sender],
        _callData
      );
  }

## Vulnerability Detail
Refer the summary section

## Impact

For transaction which are silently failing across chain are assumed as success. But actually they are silently failing by returning the error code

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Use try catch approach if the transaction want to be recorded as success always and update the state variables accordingly.
2. Return the status of the xcall and proceed further transaction based on the type of return.
