# No way to withdraw the ETH in XChainController

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
There is currently no possible way for the contract deployer/owner to withdraw the ETH. This means that value will be stuck & lost forever.

## Impact
Because pushVaultAmounts has payable modifier that can receive ETH, but there is no any withdrawETH in XChainController.  So it can cause ETH get stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L295-L322
```solidity
  function pushVaultAmounts(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint16 _chain
  ) external payable onlyWhenUnderlyingsReceived(_vaultNumber) { //@audit payable
    address vault = getVaultAddress(_vaultNumber, _chain);
    require(vault != address(0), "xChainController: not a valid vaultnumber");
    int256 totalAllocation = getCurrentTotalAllocation(_vaultNumber);
    uint256 totalWithdrawalRequests = getTotalWithdrawalRequests(_vaultNumber);
    uint256 totalUnderlying = getTotalUnderlyingVault(_vaultNumber) - totalWithdrawalRequests;
    uint256 totalSupply = getTotalSupply(_vaultNumber);

    uint256 decimals = xProvider.getDecimals(vault);
    uint256 newExchangeRate = (totalUnderlying * (10 ** decimals)) / totalSupply;

    if (!getVaultChainIdOff(_vaultNumber, _chain)) {
      int256 amountToChain = calcAmountToChain(
        _vaultNumber,
        _chain,
        totalUnderlying,
        totalAllocation
      );
      (int256 amountToDeposit, uint256 amountToWithdraw) = calcDepositWithdraw(
        _vaultNumber,
        _chain,
        amountToChain
      );

      sendXChainAmount(_vaultNumber, _chain, amountToDeposit, amountToWithdraw, newExchangeRate);
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a method to withdraw the value in the contract, for example
or remove payable in the function.

```solidity
  function withdrawBalance() external onlyOwner {
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
    require(success);
  }
```
