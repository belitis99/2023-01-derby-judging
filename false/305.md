# Unchecked length of deltas and chainIds

## Summary
Unchecked length of deltas and chainIds
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `XchainController` contract's `receiveAllocationsFromGameInt()` function, the contents of the `chainIds` list are traversed and the corresponding value of `_deltas` is taken out.

```solidity
function receiveAllocationsFromGameInt(uint256 _vaultNumber, int256[] memory _deltas) internal {
    uint256 activeVaults;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < chainIds.length; i++) {
      uint32 chain = chainIds[i];
      activeVaults += settleCurrentAllocation(_vaultNumber, chain, _deltas[i]); //@audit
      resetVaultUnderlyingForChain(_vaultNumber, chain);
    }

    resetVaultUnderlying(_vaultNumber);
    setActiveVaults(_vaultNumber, activeVaults);
    setAllocationsReceived(_vaultNumber, true);
    setReady(_vaultNumber, false);
  }
```
Here, two arrays are actually traversed, one is `chainIds` and the other is `_deltas`. But it is not determined whether the lengths of these two arrays are the same. If they are different, it may cause a revert.
