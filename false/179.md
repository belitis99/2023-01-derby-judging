# Lack of input validation in rebalanceBasket() function can result in stealing tokens from contract.

## Summary
`rebalanceBasket` function in the contract has a vulnerability that allows unlocking more tokens than what is available in the contract. This vulnerability is caused by the lack of input validation checks in the `unlockTokensFromBasket` function. 
The `unlockTokensFromBasket` function unlocks tokens from the contract and sends them to the caller, If the caller provides a value larger than the available balance, the contract can become insolvent.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
derbyToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, tokensToUnlock);
```
The `unlockTokensFromBasket()` function takes two parameters `_basketId` and `_unlockedTokenAmount` It first calls the `redeemNegativeRewards()` function, passing `_basketId` and `_unlockedTokenAmount` as parameters.
This function calculates if there are any negative rewards and how many tokens to burn, then returns the amount of tokens to burn, If there are no negative rewards, this function returns 0.

After `redeemNegativeRewards()` returns, the `unlockTokensFromBasket()` function calculates `tokensToUnlock` by subtracting the tokens burned from `_unlockedTokenAmount`. Then, it transfers `tokensToUnlock` tokens to the caller of the function using the `safeTransfer()` function of the "derbyToken" contract.

The vulnerability is in the `redeemNegativeRewards()` function, which could return a value greater than `_unlockedTokenAmount` if the `tokensToBurn` calculation is greater than `_unlockedTokenAmount`, this would cause `tokensToUnlock` to become negative, which would result in the `safeTransfer()` function transferring more tokens than what is available in the contract. 

## Impact
An attacker can call the `rebalanceBasket` function with an arbitrary amount of tokens to unlock, which can result in the contract becoming insolvent. This can cause significant financial loss to the contract owners and may make it impossible to continue the operation of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validation checks should be added to ensure that the `tokensToUnlock` variable is never negative, One possible check is to compare `tokensToBurn` with `_unlockedTokenAmount` and set `tokensToUnlock` to `_unlockedTokenAmount` if `tokensToBurn` is greater than `_unlockedTokenAmount`. 
Another possible check is to ensure that `tokensToBurn` is less than or equal to the balance of the contract before transferring tokens.
