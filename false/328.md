# MainVault.sol : rebalanceXChain is harmed for re-entrancy attack

## Summary

MainVault.sol : `rebalanceXChain` function does the rebalance when `State.SendingFundsXChain`.
Rebalancing is done based on the `amountToSendXChain` which is reset to zero at the end of the function.
The problem here is , this function is external and anyone can call this.
This can be re-entered during the cross chain or at relayer level.

## Vulnerability Detail
Cross chain rebalance starts at `[rebalanceXChain](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L307-L326)`

[xTransferToController ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L321 )will be called. 

In `xTransferToController `, if rebalancing is for homechain,  no external call. i.e, rebalancing is done without the external call.

If rebalancing in another chain, external call is done through the relayer. A malicius user, can use this route re-enter and call the rebalancing again and again.

Note : `amountToSendXChain` is not reset.

## Impact

1. Unnecessary rebalancing.
2. Loss of funds in the form of relayer fee.
3. Loss of funds in the form of slippage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Add non - re-entrant modifier.
2. Check 'amountToSendXChain > 0' , assign the `amountToSendXChain` to another varibale at the start of the function. And set the `amountToSendXChain=0` , now call for rebalancing.
