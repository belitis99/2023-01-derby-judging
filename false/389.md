# Game.sol#L465 : `pushAllocationsToVaults` is harmed for reentrancy as state is update after the operation.

## Summary


pushAllocationsToVaults - acts as Trigger to push delta allocations in protocols to cross chain vaults. pushes deltaAllocations to vaults.

The cross chain call is done based on below check,

    require(isXChainRebalancing[_vaultNumber][_chain], "Vault is not rebalancing");

But the issue here is, the `isXChainRebalancing[_vaultNumber][_chain]` state is updated after the cross chain call.

## Vulnerability Detail

Refer the summary section.

## Impact

repeated allocation for vault which might end with accounting issue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Add non-reentrant modifier.
2. update state of `isXChainRebalancing[_vaultNumber][_chain] = false` before calling the `protocolAllocationsToArray` and `pushProtocolAllocationsToVault`
