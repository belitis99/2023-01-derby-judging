# fee on transfer token will always revert for lockTokensToBasket

## Summary
When `lockTokentoBasket` is called, a require check will always cause fee on transfer token to revert as the require always underflows. Note that many of the core contracts like USDT and USDC are upgradeable, and hence they might implement a fee on transfer in the future which can break functionality for `lockTokensToBasket`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Notice when `lockTokenToBasket` is called, ` require((balanceAfter - balanceBefore - _lockedTokenAmount) == 0, "Error lock: under/overflow");` will always revert because balanceAfter - balanceBefore amount will be less than _lockedTokenAmount, thus causing an underflow and reverting.
```solidity
  function lockTokensToBasket(uint256 _lockedTokenAmount) internal {
    uint256 balanceBefore = derbyToken.balanceOf(address(this));
    derbyToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _lockedTokenAmount);
    uint256 balanceAfter = derbyToken.balanceOf(address(this));


    require((balanceAfter - balanceBefore - _lockedTokenAmount) == 0, "Error lock: under/overflow");
  }
```
