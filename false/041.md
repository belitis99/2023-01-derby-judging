# lack of event logging

## Summary
This function does not log any events to the Ethereum event log.
## Vulnerability Detail
Events are a way for smart contracts to communicate with the outside world and to provide a record of important state changes or actions that occur within the contract. If events are not logged, it can be difficult to identify when certain actions took place or to trace the flow of funds or other assets within the contract.

## Impact

Some external applications depend on events emitted to trigger some actions.
For example, a user interface for a dApp might display events to the user to provide feedback on the state of the contract or to notify the user of important events that have occurred. If events are not logged, these external applications and services may not function correctly or may not be able to provide accurate information to users.

**In our case there can be a scenario when there is an unauthorized withdrawal and the user(victim) won't be aware of it.**

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
create events for critical functions and have them logged out, so that users can know and confirm important actions that occur within the smart contract. e.g withdrawals
