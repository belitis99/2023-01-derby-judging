# lastTimeStamp can be manipulated in Mainvaul.sol

## Summary
While doing rebalancing I found that it note downs the block.timestamp in lastTimeStamp  variable .  By using this variable next time it verifies wether rebalancing is needed or not . User who does rebalancing can manipulate this lastTimeStamp variavle.


## Vulnerability Detail
In function `MainVault.pushTotalUnderlyingToController()` it note downs block.timestamp . This should not note down when rebalancing started it should note down when rebalancing is finished.

POC:
1) Bob does rebalancing he starts calling function according to the rebalancing flow.  
2) When bob calls `MainVault.pushTotalUnderlyingToController()` block.timestamp is noted in lastTimeStamp variable.
3) let's say the rebalancing period is 2 weeks. now after function `MainVault.pushTotalUnderlyingToController()` bob will not executes next functions.  (sometimes delays can happen due to other reasons may be technical, human errors, or can do himself as bob did)
4) bob executes the remaining functions in the rebalancing flow after 1 week.  In 2 weeks 1 week is already passed. now users will get only 1 week.  
5) In this way bob can waste users' rebalancing time.  because lastTimeStamp is calculated when rebalancing started 


## Impact
A man who does rebalancing can waste users' time or he can manipulate lastTimeStamp. Every function required to do rebalancing is external anyone can start rebalancing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It notes down lastTimeStamp when the rebalancing period is started to avoid this It should note down at the end of the rebalancing flow i.e in the `settleReservedFunds()` function. 

```solidity
  function settleReservedFunds() internal {
    reservedFunds += totalWithdrawalRequests;
    totalWithdrawalRequests = 0;
    state = State.RebalanceVault;
    lastTimeStamp = block.timestamp;      //solution
  }
```
