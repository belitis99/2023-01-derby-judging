# Do not support USDC

## Summary
The protocol may suffer huge losses due to USDC depeg

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the document,USDC is the main currency that should be deposited(https://derby-finance.gitbook.io/derby-finance-docs/products/vaults). The vaults automatically swaps this for USDT or DAI if the underlying DeFi protocol requires this.  I believe we are already aware of the recent events, the depegging of the USDC stablecoin has affected other stablecoins, wreaking havoc on crypto projects and stakeholders in a massive chain reaction.


## Impact
The protocol may suffer huge losses due to USDC depeg
