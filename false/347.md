# Malfunctioning/Malicious Vault cannot be removed from Derby Protocol

## Summary
There is no way to remove a malfunctioning / malicious Vault from the Derby Protocol

## Vulnerability Detail
The Guardian role is able to set parameters of the Derby Finance protocol in case of problem.
However, there is no mechanism to remove a malfunctionning or malicious Vault from the protocol.

Even if a Vault is added through the DAO, there should be a way to remove a Vault from the protocol.

## Impact
Vaults are trusted for sensitive actions on the protocol.
For instance, a vault is able to [blacklist a protocol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Controller.sol#L117-L122). 
However parameters vaultNumber and the protocolId are trusted if the sender is a Vault.
Hence, a malicious Vault blacklist all protocols of all the Vaults and DOS the Derby Protocol.


## Code Snippet

```solidity
  function setProtocolBlacklist(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint256 _protocolNum
  ) external override onlyVault {
    protocolBlacklist[_vaultNumber][_protocolNum] = true;   //@audit-issue _vaultNumber and _protocolNumber are trusted once the call is emitted by a Vault
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create in `Controller.sol` a function that enables Guardian role of the protocol to remove a Vault.
```solidity
function removeVault(address _vault) external onlyGuardian {
    ...
}
```
