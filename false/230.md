# User's funds can stuck in contract forever.

## Summary
MainVault.sol contains a function withdrawalRequest() used to request withdrawal amount. I found the way through which users can lose their funds forever.
## Vulnerability Detail
MainVault.sol contains a function withdrawalRequest() used to request withdrawal amount . if the user enters 0 amount to request then the user's fund can be stuck in the contract forever.

POC:
1) Bob is trying to request 500 USDT to withdraw using `withdrawalRequest()` but mistakenly he enters the amount as 0.
```solidity
  function withdrawalRequest(
    uint256 _amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");  
    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);   

    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
    totalWithdrawalRequests += value;
  }
```
2) There is no input validation now `user.withdrawalAllowance = 0`,   `user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = [some value] ` .
3) After rebalancing  bob will try to withdraw the amount using the function `withdrawAllowance()`.  but in `withdrawAllowance()` there is validation of `require(user.withdrawalAllowance > 0, allowanceError);` that's why transaction will revert
```solidity
  function withdrawAllowance() external nonReentrant onlyWhenIdle returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalAllowance > 0, allowanceError);     //this validation
    require(rebalancingPeriod > user.withdrawalRequestPeriod, "Funds not arrived");  

    value = user.withdrawalAllowance;
    value = checkForBalance(value);    

    reservedFunds -= value;
    delete user.withdrawalAllowance;
    delete user.withdrawalRequestPeriod;  

    transferFunds(msg.sender, value);
  }
``` 
4) Now bob got his mistake now bob will again try to request the right amount using `withdrawalRequest()`. now for Bob `withdrawalRequest()` will always revert. because of validation `require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request"); ` you can check step 2 `user.withdrawalRequestPeriod` is already set to  `user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = [some value]`. That's why user can't request withdrawal amount anymore . now for Bob `withdrawalRequest()` will always revert . now bobs fund is stuck in contract forever.

```solidity
  function withdrawalRequest(
    uint256 _amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");  //This validation 

    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);    
    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
    totalWithdrawalRequests += value;
  }
```
## Impact
If the user enters 0 amount as a withdrawal request in function `withdrawalRequest()` then the user's fund can stuck in the contract forever.  again user can't request a withdrawal amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be check while requesting withdrawal amount whether the amount is greater than 0 In `withdrawalRequest()` function
```solidity
  function withdrawalRequest(
    uint256 _amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");
    require(_amount > 0, "amount is less than 0");                            // solution line
    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);

    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
    totalWithdrawalRequests += value;
  }
```
