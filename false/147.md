# Missing two-step process to change privileged role `dao`

## Summary
In contracts `IGoverned.sol`, `Game.sol`, `Vault.sol`, `XChainController.sol`, and `XProvider.sol`  there is a `setDao` function that does not support a two-step transfer role pattern.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation provides a specific function `setDao()` to allow for possible `dao` address updates. However, the current implementation achieves its goal within a single transaction. This is reasonable under the assumption that the `_dao` parameter is always correctly provided. However, in the unlikely situation, when an incorrect `_dao` is provided, the contract role `dao` may be forever lost, which might be devastating for any listed contracts.

## Impact
Transferring `dao` is a critical operation, and this could lead to transferring it to an inaccessible wallet e.g. by mistake.

## Code Snippet
Function `setDao` in contracts `IGoverned.sol`, `Game.sol`, `Vault.sol`, `XChainController.sol`, and `XProvider.sol`:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to implement a two-step transfer role mechanism where the role is transferred and later claimed by a new `dao` to confirm the whole process and prevent a lockout. Note: this is relevant for all the contracts:  `IGoverned.sol` `Game.sol`, `Vault.sol`, `XChainController.sol` and `XProvider.sol` 

A good hint also could be to implement in the same way as OpenZepellin `Ownable2Step` contract -  https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#Ownable2Step
