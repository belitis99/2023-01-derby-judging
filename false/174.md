# "setProtocolBlacklist()" function allows for unauthorized protocol blacklisting.

## Summary
The function `setProtocolBlacklist()` allows anyone to add a protocol to the blacklist. Though the function is only accessible to whitelisted vaults, it is not sufficient to prevent malicious actors from adding protocols to the blacklist.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Controller.sol#L26

The `setProtocolBlacklist()` function takes in two arguments, `_vaultNumber` and `_protocolNum`, which are used to access the `protocolBlacklist` mapping. The mapping is defined as `mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => bool)) public protocolBlacklist`, where the first key is the `vaultNumber`, the second key is the `protocolNumber`, and the value is a boolean indicating whether the protocol is blacklisted.

The problem is the `setProtocolBlacklist()` function is not restricted to only be called by a whitelisted vault, Instead, anyone can call the function and add a protocol to the blacklist. This is because the `onlyVault` modifier, which restricts access to only whitelisted vaults, is not applied to the `setProtocolBlacklist()` function.

Thus, a malicious actor could call the `setProtocolBlacklist()` function and add a legitimate protocol to the blacklist, causing a loss of funds or preventing users from accessing the protocol. This could have serious consequences, as users may lose faith in the security of the contract and the underlying protocol, leading to a loss of funds and reputation for the project. 

## Impact
This vulnerability allows any attacker to add a protocol to the blacklist, which can potentially prevent its use in the protocol. As a result, this can cause financial loss to the users of the protocol. Additionally, it can damage the reputation of the protocol, which may lead to a decrease in user adoption.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `onlyVault` modifier should be added to the `setProtocolBlacklist()` function to ensure that only whitelisted vaults can access it.


1. Implement proper access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can call the `setProtocolBlacklist()` function.

2. Whitelist only trusted contracts to have access to the `setProtocolBlacklist()` function.

3. Consider using a multi-signature mechanism to add new protocols to the blacklist.
