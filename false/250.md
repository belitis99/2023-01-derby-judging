# Pullfunds can end before the necessary funds have been pulled

## Summary
Pullfunds can end before the necessary funds have been pulled. When this happens, the vault won't have enough balance to complete the subsequent steps.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L116-L122
Suppose shortage > balanceProtocol, and balanceProtocol < minimumPull, then this loop ends while there is still a shortage.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L104
minimumPull is initialized to 1000000, and shortage will usually be greater than 1000000 (as long as the protocol has a low index). So if the protocol's balance is very low (maybe it was given a very low allocation), then this condition can be satisfied.

## Impact
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L310
When the vulnerability happens here, then there won't be enough fund for the subsequent transfer, causing rebalanceXChain to fail and the rebalance process to be interrupted. The vault will not be usable on all chains since deposit & withdraw functions require the vault to be in the idle state.

Also, as far as I can tell, there is no good way for the guardian to correct this.

## Recommendation

I believe it should be continue instead of break.
