# Setting of governanceFee bigger than 10_000 may lead to underflow exception

## Summary
Setting of governanceFee bigger than 10_000 may lead to underflow exception

## Vulnerability Detail
Setting of `governanceFee` bigger than 10_000 in `setGovernanceFee` may lead to underflow exception in function `transferFunds`
## Impact
If `governanceFee` bigger than 10_000 may lead to underflow exception during executing of transfer to receiver address.

```solidity
uint256 govFee = (_value * governanceFee) / 10_000;
```
`govFee` variable will be bigger than `_value` and during the transfer ot value to receiver 
```solidity
vaultCurrency.safeTransfer(_receiver, _value - govFee);
```
may lead to underflow arithmetic exception. 

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L188

```solidity
  function transferFunds(address _receiver, uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 govFee = (_value * governanceFee) / 10_000;

    vaultCurrency.safeTransfer(getDao(), govFee);
    vaultCurrency.safeTransfer(_receiver, _value - govFee);
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add additional check in function `setGovernanceFee`

```solidity
  function setGovernanceFee(uint16 _fee) external onlyGuardian {
    if(_fee > 10_000) revert FeeTooBig()
    governanceFee = _fee;
  }
```
