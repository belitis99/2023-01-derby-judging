# Uncontrolled length of array can cause DOS attack

## Summary
If the guardian's address is compromised, the contract might be non-functional.

## Vulnerability Detail
We have the "uint32[] public chainIds;" variable which the guardian controls through the "setChainIds(uint32[] memory _chainIds) external onlyGuardian" function.

If the guardian address is hacked (private key stolen or phishing attack), the malicious address can add many items to the array and make the following function non-usable (the execution price for a transaction will exceed the block's gas limit): "rebalanceBasket", "addToTotalRewards", "pushAllocationsToController".

As well the malicious address can be removed through the DAO using "setGuardian" function but we do not have a function to delete the elements of "chainIds" that were added during the DOS attack so the contract will need to be redeployed.

## Impact
"rebalanceBasket", "addToTotalRewards", "pushAllocationsToController". will ever due to high gas price (> block gas limit).

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L59

  function setChainIds(uint32[] memory _chainIds) external onlyGuardian {
    chainIds = _chainIds;
  }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a function that will allow deleting elements of the chainId array.
