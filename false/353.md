# possible DOS in `settleDeltaAllocations()` function because of unbounded gas consumption

## Summary
In the Game.sol contract `settleDeltaAllocations()` function is declared . `settleDeltaAllocations()` gets input as  array and iterates through a number of _deltaAllocations and protocols. Also, it executes many functions on each iteration. for loops inside for looop also is used in this function. Every time this calculation is gas-consuming.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The `settleDeltaAllocations()` function fetched all elements of the list from storage, which is really gas-consuming and even can break the block gas limit in case the list is too large. , this function is still failed if its gas cost larger than the block gas limit. most likely `settleDeltaAllocations()` will always fail because it's first for loop iterates through _deltaAllocations and inside this for loop there is another for loop which will be iterating through protocalsId's  which is more gas consuming.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 The function `settleDeltaAllocations()` should not do this amount of iterate in the same function
