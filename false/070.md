# Multiplication before division causes imprecise totalUnredeemedRewards

## Summary

Ethereum doesn't allow floating point values, causing truncation issues when multiplying the result of a division. Truncated value are not precise, so multiplication before division is required when making said calculations. When Derby calculates negative rewards in Game.sol, the final totalUnredeemedRewards is imprecise because division before multiplication can occur.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L303

1. `tokensToBurn` is the result of a division

2. When `tokensToBurn` is less than `_unlcokedTokens` `tokensToBurn` will remain the calculated result of a division

3. `baskets[_basketId].totalUnRedeemedRewards` multiplied the result of a division

## Impact

While truncated math can lead to small rounding errors, this can total up to significant fund loss as the lifespan of Derby grows and its volume increases.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Refactor the `totalUnRedeemedRewards` using multiplication before division.
