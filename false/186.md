# int256 data type for the totalCurrentAllocation variable, allows an attacker to manipulate the value of the totalCurrentAllocation variable to steal funds from the contract.

## Summary
The `XChainController` contract uses `uint256 and int256` data types for variables that represent amounts or balances in the contract, including the "totalUnderlying" variable.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  struct vaultInfo {
    int256 totalCurrentAllocation;
    uint256 totalUnderlying;
```

The `totalCurrentAllocation` variable is an `int256` data type, which can be exploited to trigger integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities, attackers can manipulate the value of this variable to steal funds from the contract.

Suppose an attacker manipulates these values using overflow or underflow, In that case, they can change the expected values, leading to the contract's malfunctioning or an unintended transfer of funds to an attacker's account. For example, an attacker can increase the balance of their account by setting a negative value for the `totalUnderlying` variable, which will wrap around to a large value instead of throwing an error.

## Impact
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to steal funds from the contract, The amount of funds that could be stolen depends on the size of the overflow/underflow.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract should use the "SafeMath" library to prevent integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.
The "SafeMath" library is designed to protect against such vulnerabilities by reverting transactions that would cause them.
