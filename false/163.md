# `xChainController` will send funds multiple times to the same vault

## Summary
[sendFundsToVault()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L409-L441) is pushing the funds from `xChainController` to vaults until this statement turned to `true` 
```solidity
if (vaultStage[_vaultNumber].fundsSent == chainIds.length) resetVaultStages(_vaultNumber);
``` 
So `vaultStage[_vaultNumber].fundsSent` should be equal to `chainIds.length`.
If the vault needs to receive funds from `xChainController` you will just invoke `sendFundsToVault()` and this will increment `fundsSent`
```solidity
vaultStage[_vaultNumber].fundsSent++;
```
## Vulnerability Detail
But if the vault X will send funds to `xChainController`. you should not be able to invoke `sendFundsToVault()` to vault X.

Also, malicious users could invoke `sendFundsToVault()` with the same `_vaultNumber` and `_chain` multiple times (this will transfer the `amountToDeposit` again to the vault), this will increment `fundsSent` to any number (the max is `chainIds.length`).

After that, this statement turned into `true` 
```solidity
if (vaultStage[_vaultNumber].fundsSent == chainIds.length) resetVaultStages(_vaultNumber);
``` 
and `sendFundsToVault()` is not callable now.

`xChainController` contract still has funds and some vaults still waiting for the funds (now the protocol is broken)

At the same time [sendXChainAmount()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L368-L401) should increment `fundsSent` in case the vault will not send any funds. 

## Impact
`xChainController` will send funds multiple times to the same vault

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
  function sendXChainAmount(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint32 _chainId,
    int256 _amountDeposit,
    uint256 _amountToWithdraw,
    uint256 _exchangeRate
  ) internal {
    address vault = getVaultAddress(_vaultNumber, _chainId);
    bool receivingFunds;
    uint256 amountToSend = 0;

    if (_amountDeposit > 0 && _amountDeposit < minimumAmount) {
      vaultStage[_vaultNumber].fundsReceived++;
+    vaultStage[_vaultNumber].fundsSent++;
    } else if (_amountDeposit >= minimumAmount) {
      receivingFunds = true;
      setAmountToDeposit(_vaultNumber, _chainId, _amountDeposit);
+    vaultStage[_vaultNumber].fundsReceived++;
    }

    if (_amountToWithdraw > 0 && _amountToWithdraw < uint(minimumAmount)) {
      vaultStage[_vaultNumber].fundsReceived++;
      vaultStage[_vaultNumber].fundsSent++;
    } else if (_amountToWithdraw >= uint(minimumAmount)) {
      amountToSend = _amountToWithdraw;
+    vaultStage[_vaultNumber].fundsSent++;
    } 

    xProvider.pushSetXChainAllocation{value: msg.value}(
      vault,
      _chainId,
      amountToSend,
      _exchangeRate,
      receivingFunds
    );
    emit SendXChainAmount(vault, _chainId, amountToSend, _exchangeRate, receivingFunds);
  }
```

Also, add checks to call `sendFundsToVault()` only one time for the same vault
