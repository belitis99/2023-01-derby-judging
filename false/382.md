# setTotalUnderlyingInt() underlyingReceived Counting may be incorrect

## Summary
setTotalUnderlyingInt() underlyingReceived Counting may be incorrect
## Vulnerability Detail
setTotalUnderlyingInt() will be ++ for underlyingReceived
code as follows:
```solidity
  function setTotalUnderlyingInt(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint32 _chainId,
    uint256 _underlying,
    uint256 _totalSupply,
    uint256 _withdrawalRequests
  ) internal {
    vaults[_vaultNumber].totalUnderlyingPerChain[_chainId] = _underlying;
    vaults[_vaultNumber].withdrawalRequests[_chainId] = _withdrawalRequests;
    vaults[_vaultNumber].totalSupply += _totalSupply;
    vaults[_vaultNumber].totalUnderlying += _underlying;
    vaults[_vaultNumber].totalWithdrawalRequests += _withdrawalRequests;
    vaultStage[_vaultNumber].underlyingReceived++; //<------underlyingReceived will ++
  }
```
```console
underlyingReceivedï¼š underlyings received from all active vault contracts
```

But the current operation does not determine whether the current vault is an activeVault
Non-active vault will also +++
Must be added to be activeVault before ++, to avoid calculation errors

## Recommendation
```solidity
  function setTotalUnderlyingInt(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint32 _chainId,
    uint256 _underlying,
    uint256 _totalSupply,
    uint256 _withdrawalRequests
  ) internal {
    vaults[_vaultNumber].totalUnderlyingPerChain[_chainId] = _underlying;
    vaults[_vaultNumber].withdrawalRequests[_chainId] = _withdrawalRequests;
    vaults[_vaultNumber].totalSupply += _totalSupply;
    vaults[_vaultNumber].totalUnderlying += _underlying;
    vaults[_vaultNumber].totalWithdrawalRequests += _withdrawalRequests;
+   if (!vaults[_vaultNumber].chainIdOff[_chainId]){    
      vaultStage[_vaultNumber].underlyingReceived++; 
+   }
  }
