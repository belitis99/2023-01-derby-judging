# XProvider.xTransfer can send not enough amount as relayer fee, as result tx will be waiting for execution for a long time

## Summary
XProvider.xTransfer can send not enough amount as relayer fee, as result tx will be waiting for execution for a long time.
## Vulnerability Detail
XProvider.xTransfer is created for sending funds using `connext`. Each connext `xCall` should pay fee for relayers.

```solidity
  function xTransfer(
    address _token,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _recipient,
    uint32 _destinationDomain,
    uint256 _slippage,
    uint256 _relayerFee
  ) internal {
    require(
      IERC20(_token).allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= _amount,
      "User must approve amount"
    );


    // User sends funds to this contract
    IERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);


    // This contract approves transfer to Connext
    IERC20(_token).approve(address(connext), _amount);


    IConnext(connext).xcall{value: (msg.value - _relayerFee)}(
      _destinationDomain, // _destination: Domain ID of the destination chain
      _recipient, // _to: address receiving the funds on the destination
      _token, // _asset: address of the token contract
      msg.sender, // _delegate: address that can revert or forceLocal on destination
      _amount, // _amount: amount of tokens to transfer
      _slippage, // _slippage: the maximum amount of slippage the user will accept in BPS (e.g. 30 = 0.3%)
      bytes("") // _callData: empty bytes because we're only sending funds
    );
  }
```

As you can see, this function is setting `msg.value - _relayerFee` as payment for relayers. And `XProvider.xSend` sets [msg.value or relayerFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L113). 
Why it's done in such way? Because some function of  `XProvider` should send 2 connext txs in same time, so they should pay relayerFee 2 times.

For example [`xTransferToController` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L332-L333) and [`xTransferToVaults` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L374-L375).

So the idea is next, both that function are called with msg.value == relayerFee*2. So 1 part(one relayerFee) is paid for 1 tx, and another is paid for another tx.

But the problem is that there is no check, that `msg.value==relayerFee*2`. Because of that function `xTransferToVaults` can pass in order if `msg.value >= relayerFee && msg.value < relayerFee`. As for first tx relayerFee will be passed(which is ok), but for second(xTransfer) `msg.value - relayerFee` will be passed, which can be small value.
As result seconds tx can be waiting for along time, once any relayer will execute it. And protocol will need to bump it and increase fee.

Example.
1.Current relayer fee is 0.01 eth.
2.Someone calls `XChainController.sendFundsToVault` which triggers `XProvider.xTransferToVaults` and provides 0.011 eth(by mistake) as msg.value and 0.01 as `_relayerFee`.
3.`pushFeedbackToVault` [paid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L374) `_relayerFee` as fee, so it's 0.001 eth left
4.`xTransfer` [paid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XProvider.sol#L375) 0.001 eth as fee.
5.As result `xTransfer` tx was sent with small fee, so it can be stucked for a long time, when any relayer will execute it
## Impact
Tx can be stuck as small relayer fee is provided.

## Recommendation
Check that `msg.value==relayerFee*2`
