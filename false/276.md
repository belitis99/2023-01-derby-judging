# `maxDivergenceWithdraws`, `minimumAmount`, `minimumPull` doesn't work well for tokens with decimals != 6

## Summary
`maxDivergenceWithdraws`, `minimumAmount`, `minimumPull` are set at deploy to certain values that will not work well for other tokens than `USDC`

## Vulnerability Detail
Tokens like `EURS` (2 decimals) or `wBTC`, (8 decimals but high value) or any 18 decimal token like `DAI` will not work with the constructor defined values of these three constants.

`maxDivergenceWithdraws` and `minimumAmount` can be changed after deploy by `dao` but `minimumPull` cannot. Hence using the vaults with other tokens than `USDC` (or similar decimal tokens) can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Impact
Using the vault with other tokens than 6 decimal tokens can cause unexpected behavior. Especially for `minimumPull` which cannot be changed. Together with [another issue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby-0ximmeas/issues/5) this can cause funds not to be pulled when needed.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend that the protocol changes to pass them as constructor parameters. And also adds a way for guardian to change `minimumPull`
