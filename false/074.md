# No check for valid address when setting homeVault

## Summary
There are no checks when setting the homeVault address whether the address is valid

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
  /// @notice Setter for homeVault address
  /// @param _homeVault new address of homeVault on this chain
  function setHomeVault(address _homeVault) external onlyDao {
    homeVault = _homeVault;
  }
```
The `setHomeVault` function does not check whether the `_homeVault` argument is a zero address, therefore the `homeVault` could be accidentally or deliberately set to the zero address.

## Impact
Setting the homeVault to the zero address could make the contract unusable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
require that the `_homeVault` argument is not the zero address

```solidity
  /// @notice Setter for homeVault address
  /// @param _homeVault new address of homeVault on this chain
  function setHomeVault(address _homeVault) external onlyDao {
    require(_homeVault != address(0), "HomeVault address cannot be 0");
    homeVault = _homeVault;
  }
```
