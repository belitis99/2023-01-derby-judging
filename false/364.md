# Game.sol: owner privileged function can be accessed by anyone.

## Summary

In Game.sol, the function , some of the view functions are only accessed by the owner of the basket.

We can see this for [basketAllocationInProtocol ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L215 ) and  for [basketUnredeemedRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L236).

This is inline with what the natspec comments says.

    /// @notice function to see the total unredeemed rewards the basket has built up. Only the owner of the basket can view this.

But the function `[basketTotalAllocatedTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L191)` is not under protection. 

Here what the comment says,
