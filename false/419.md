# vault.sol

## Summary
Medium
Minimum pull cannot be updated in Vault.sol:
Minimumpull should have a function to increase or decrease it's value depending on market conditions but it is hard coded in the constructor.
I suggest a function 
```function change MinimumPull(uint256 _minimumPull)  external onlyDao{
    minimumPull = _minimumPull
}```


Else 
It's declaration should be set to Immutable:

```  uint256 public immutable minimumPull;
