# Malicious game players can vote for unfavorable chains/protocols without being punished

## Summary
A division rounding issue can allow users to vote for chains/protocols without any consequences.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L233-L242
When a certain protocol on a certain chain performs badly, it gets reflected in the reward calculation.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L361
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L384-L398
The players that voted for this protocol will receive negative rewards.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L303-L308
The next time they need to withdraw tokens from the game, part of their tokens will be burned as punishment.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L358
Observe that there's no limit for how small the basket's allocation in a protocol is.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L357
They will be added to the vault's delta allocations regardless.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L381-L382
Yet, the player's allocation in the protocol is floor divided by 1E18 when the game calculates the reward.

Suppose a malicious user allocates 9.9E17 to a certain protocol of a certain vault, they will be able to influence that vault almost as much as if they allocated 1E18, but they won't be impacted by negative reward.

## Impact
This bug allows malicious users to vote for unfavorable protocols/chains. This can potentially cause the vault to lose money.
While the impact of a single instance of this exploit may be small, observe that malicious users can mint numerous baskets and repeatedly exploit this to amplify the impact. This is especially effective in the early game when not many players are voting for the victim vault.

## Recommendation
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L381
Instead of dividing by 1e18 here^

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L396-L398
I believe it's better to divide there^
