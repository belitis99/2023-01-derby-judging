    // mint Basket with nrOfUnAllocatedTokens equal to _lockedTokenAmount
    baskets[latestBasketId].vaultNumber = _vaultNumber;
    baskets[latestBasketId].lastRebalancingPeriod = vaults[_vaultNumber].rebalancingPeriod + 1;
    _safeMint(msg.sender, latestBasketId);
    latestBasketId++;

    emit BasketId(msg.sender, latestBasketId - 1);
