# More than `100%` (`10_000`) can be assigned into the `governanceFee`, which lead to the underflow of the calculation of `_value - govFee` that is used as the amount in the vaultCurrency.safeTransfer()

## Summary
Due to lack of  input validation whether or not new fee assigned into the `_fee` parameter would be less than `100%` (`10_000`), the caller (Guardian) accidentally can assign more than `100%` (`10_000`) into the `_fee` and then it would be assigned into the `governanceFee` within the MainVault#`setGovernanceFee()`.

This lead to a bad situation that incorrect percentage may be assigned into the `governanceFee`. And then, it may also lead to the underflow of the calculation of `_value - govFee` that is used as the amount in the vaultCurrency.safeTransfer() within MainVault#`transferFunds().


## Vulnerability Detail
Within the MainVault, 
the `governanceFee` would be defined as a basis point (BPS) like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L37
```solidity
  uint256 public governanceFee; // Basis points
```

Within the MainVault#`constructor()`, 
`0` would be assigned into the `governanceFee`  like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L66
```solidity
  constructor(
    string memory _name,
    string memory _symbol,
    uint8 _decimals,
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    address _dao,
    address _game,
    address _controller,
    address _vaultCurrency,
    uint256 _uScale
  )
    VaultToken(_name, _symbol, _decimals)
    Vault(_vaultNumber, _dao, _controller, _vaultCurrency, _uScale)
  {
    ...
    governanceFee = 0;  /// @audit
    ... 
  }
```

Within the MainVault#`setGovernanceFee()`, 
new fee assigned into the `_fee` parameter would be assigned into the `governanceFee` by the Guardian like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L457-L458
```solidity
  /// @notice Setter for governance fee
  /// @param _fee Fee in basis points
  function setGovernanceFee(uint16 _fee) external onlyGuardian { /// @audit
    governanceFee = _fee;  /// @audit
  }
```

Within the MainVault#`transferFunds()`, 
the `governanceFee` would be transferred into the `_receiver` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L185
```solidity
  /// @notice Substract governance fee from value
  /// @param _receiver Receiving adress for the vaultcurrency
  /// @param _value Amount received by seller in vaultCurrency
  function transferFunds(address _receiver, uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 govFee = (_value * governanceFee) / 10_000;  /// @audit

    vaultCurrency.safeTransfer(getDao(), govFee);
    vaultCurrency.safeTransfer(_receiver, _value - govFee);
  }
```

However, within the MainVault#`setGovernanceFee()` above, there is no input validation whether or not new fee assigned into the `_fee` parameter would be less than `100%` (`10_000`) in BPS. 
This allow the caller (Guardian) to accidentally assign more than `100%` (`10_000`) into the `_fee` and then it would be assigned into the `governanceFee` within the MainVault#`setGovernanceFee()` above. 

example). 
If the caller (Guardian) to accidentally assign `100_000` into the `_fee` and then it would be assigned into the `governanceFee`  within the MainVault#`setGovernanceFee()` above, the `govFee` will be 10 times larger than the `_value` within MainVault#`transferFunds()` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L185
```solidity
uint256 govFee = (_value * governanceFee) / 10_000;
uint256 govFee = (_value * 100_000) / 10_000;
```
As a result, within MainVault#`transferFunds(), the calculation of `_value - govFee` that is used as the amount in the vaultCurrency.safeTransfer() will be underflow:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L188
```solidity
    vaultCurrency.safeTransfer(_receiver, _value - govFee);
```

## Impact
This lead to a bad situation that incorrect percentage may be assigned into the `governanceFee`. And then, it may also lead to the underflow of the calculation of `_value - govFee` that is used as the amount in the vaultCurrency.safeTransfer() within MainVault#`transferFunds().

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding an input validation whether or not the new fee assigned into the `_fee` parameter would be less than 100% (10_000) to the MainVault#`setGovernanceFee()` like this:
```solidity
  function setGovernanceFee(uint16 _fee) external onlyGuardian {
+   require(_fee <= 10000, "new fee must be less than 100%");
    governanceFee = _fee;
  }
```
