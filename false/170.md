# Asking for `balanceOf()` in the wrong address

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
on [sendFundsToVault()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L409-L441) this logic
```solidity
address underlying = getUnderlyingAddress(_vaultNumber, _chain);
uint256 balance = IERC20(underlying).balanceOf(address(this));
```
in case `_chainId` is Optimism 
the `underlying` address is for  Optimism (L2) 
but  `XChainController` is on Mainnet
you can't invoke `balanceOf()` like this!!!

## Impact
Asking for `balanceOf()` in the wrong address
The protocol will be not able to rebalance the vault

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`getUnderlyingAddress(_vaultNumber, _chain);` should just be `getUnderlyingAddress(_vaultNumber);`
so the `underlying` here
```solidity
uint256 balance = IERC20(underlying).balanceOf(address(this));
```
will be always on the Mainnet
