# Unbounded loop leading to DoS if the value of latestID is too large

## Summary

Unbounded loop leading to DoS by exceeding gas limit if the value of latestID is too large.

## Vulnerability Detail

If there are too many vaults deployed, many functions such as `claimTokens()`, `executeDeposits()`, `rewardsToArray()`, `rebalanceCheckProtocols()`, `setTotalUnderlying()` will revert due to exceeding the gas limit because the value of `latestID` will may be too large.

```solidity
  function claimTokens() public {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;
      bool claim = controller.claim(vaultNumber, i);
      if (claim) {
        address govToken = controller.getGovToken(vaultNumber, i);
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20(govToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        Swap.swapTokensMulti(
          Swap.SwapInOut(tokenBalance, govToken, address(vaultCurrency)),
          controller.getUniswapParams(),
          false
        );
      }
    }
  }
```
## Impact

Unbounded loop leading to DoS if there is too many vaults.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend breaking up the loop to accommodate smaller indexes so the protocol will not break when there is too many new vaults.
