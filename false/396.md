# MainVault.sol : checkForBalance is not returning the correct value.

## Summary

`checkForBalance()` is used in `withdrawAllowance()` and in `withdrawRewards()`. 
Inside this function there is check to ensure the as per comment,

   /// @notice Sometimes when swapping stable coins the vault will get a fraction of a coin less then expected
  /// @notice This is to make sure the vault doesnt get stuck
  /// @notice Value will be set to the vaultBalance
  /// @notice When divergence is greater then maxDivergenceWithdraws it will revert
  /// @param _value Value the user wants to withdraw
  /// @return value Value - divergence

Since `getVaultBalance()` is done one after another, not sure how this prevent the above mentioned issue.

if it is going to incur the difference, then fraction value would be a loss. Value would depend of the fractional  dollar value.
