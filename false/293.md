# withdrawals can be paused which stops blacklisting

## Summary
Withdrawals can be paused for Aave and possibly other future protocols which prevents blacklisting.


## Vulnerability Detail
Blacklisting a protocol requires that you do a withdrawal:

This might not always be possible, Aave as an example can pause withdrawals:
https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/ce53c4a8c8620125063168620eba0a8a92854eb8/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L146

Other possible protocols as well.

This means that a blacklisting of a protocol might not be possible. This can stop deposits/withdrawals from it, halting rebalancing and processing withdrawal requests and rewards to game.

## Impact
If a pool goes insolvent or is compromised the provider (like Aave) might pause withdrawals. Since blacklisting a protocol requires a withdraw that can stop `guardian` from blacklisting when needed.

If a protocol stays paused for a long time it can hold up rebalancing which stops withdrawal requests and rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Have blacklist and withdraw from protocol separated to two different calls.

Since the vault will still hold the shares in the underlying pool this would allow the protocol to be re-added or at least shares retrieved at a later stage (when unpaused).
