# rebalance() method may fail when reward token ( gov token) are too small to swap on dex

## Summary
`rebalance()` method may fail when reward token ( gov token) are too small to swap on Dex

## Vulnerability Detail
`rebalance()` method claims the reward token ( aka gov token) of provider and swap it to `vaultCurrency`. When reward token are very small that result in 0 `amountOut` then swap will fail at dex itself. For example- `ISwapRouter(_uniswap.router).exactInput(params)` will fail when `amountIn` of `tokenIn` is too small to get `amountOut`.

## Impact
`rebalance()` fails when reward amount is very small .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement try-catch around `claimTokens()` so that it does not block execution of `rebalance()`.  Unused `govToken` may remains in contract for next `rebalance()`  event
