# wrong check can cause users unable to deposti after some amount e.g. user wants to deposit max but cannot after certain amount cannot

## Summary
the wrong check can cause users unable to deposit after some amount e.g. user wants to deposit max but cannot after a certain amount cannot 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity 

      require(_amount + balanceSender <= maxTrainingDeposit);
```
for example, user wants to deposit in main value contract, if users balance was equal or near to max amount with plus the amount of the deposit will cause user not to pass require a check and cannot deposit. 
## Impact
 will cause user not to pass require a check and cannot deposit. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
function deposit(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 shares) {
    if (training) {
      require(whitelist[msg.sender]);
      uint256 balanceSender = (balanceOf(msg.sender) * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());
      require(_amount + balanceSender <= maxTrainingDeposit);
    }

    uint256 balanceBefore = getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;
    vaultCurrency.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    uint256 balanceAfter = getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;

    uint256 amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
    shares = (amount * (10 ** decimals())) / exchangeRate;

    _mint(_receiver, shares);
  }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
consider modifying the logic of function that the amount should not sum to balance of sender
