# Centralization Risk and No max threshold for fees

## Summary

Verify that a threshold for maximum fees has been established, preventing the administrator from setting it at an excessively high amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

A guardian can set the governanceFee value he/she wants

## Impact

In case of error or bad behavior, fees could be set to an huge number, making Derby Vaults useless

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L457 

```solidity 
  /// @notice Setter for governance fee
  /// @param _fee Fee in basis points
  function setGovernanceFee(uint16 _fee) external onlyGuardian {
      governanceFee = _fee;
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review
VSCode

## Recommendation

Create a constant variable MAX_FEE to ensure that Guardian don't make mistake or don't misbehave
```solidity 
  /// @notice Setter for governance fee
  /// @param _fee Fee in basis points
  function setGovernanceFee(uint16 _fee) external onlyGuardian {
  +   require(_fee <= MAX_FEE ,"_fee can't be higher than the threshold");
      governanceFee = _fee;
  }
```
