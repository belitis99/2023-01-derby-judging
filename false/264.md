# The `_uScale` assigned within the MainVault#`constructor()` may not correspond to the number of decimals of the `_vaultCurrency` assigned, which lead to the precision loss of the calculations within the MainVault#`deposit()` and  the MainVault#`withdraw()`

## Summary
According to [discord](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1079779958982967316/1080882295440932865),
`uScale` would be equal to `10**vaultCurrency.decimals()`.

However, within the MainVault#`constructor()` above, there is no input validation to check whether or not the `_uScale` assigned would be correspond to the number of decimals of the `_vaultCurrency` assigned. 
This allow a caller to assign arbitrary number of decimals as an argument into the `_uScale` parameter and it may not correspond to the actual number of decimals of `_vaultCurrency`.

This lead to a bad situation that the number of decimals between a `_vaultCurrency` and `_uScale` within the  MainVault#`constructor()` may not correspond. 
As a result, the `exchangeRate` that the `_uScale` was assigned within the MainVault#`constructor()` may not correspond to  the number of decimals of the `_vaultCurrency` assigned. 

This vulnerability lead to the precision loss of the calculations within the MainVault#`deposit()` and  the MainVault#`withdraw()`.


## Vulnerability Detail
Within the MainVault,
the `exchangeRate` would be defined like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L34
```solidity
  uint256 public exchangeRate;
```

Within the MainVault#`constructor()`,
the `_uScale` would be defined as a parameter and then it would be assigned into the `exchangeRate` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L59
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L64
```solidity
  constructor(
    string memory _name,
    string memory _symbol,
    uint8 _decimals,
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    address _dao,
    address _game,
    address _controller,
    address _vaultCurrency,
    uint256 _uScale /// @audit 
  )
    VaultToken(_name, _symbol, _decimals)
    Vault(_vaultNumber, _dao, _controller, _vaultCurrency, _uScale)
  {
    exchangeRate = _uScale;  /// @audit 
    ...
  }
```

Within the MainVault#`deposit()`,
the `exchangeRate` that the `_uScale` was assigned would be used like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L121
```solidity
  function deposit(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 shares) {
    ...
    uint256 amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
    shares = (amount * (10 ** decimals())) / exchangeRate;  /// @audit 

    _mint(_receiver, shares);
  }
```

Within the MainVault#`withdraw()`,
the `exchangeRate` that the `_uScale` was assigned would be also used like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L136
```solidity
  function withdraw(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver,
    address _owner
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());  /// @audit

    require(value > 0, "!value");

    require(getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds >= value, "!funds");

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    transferFunds(_receiver, value);
  }
```

`uScale` would be equal to `10**vaultCurrency.decimals()`.

However, within the MainVault#`constructor()` above, there is no input validation to check whether or not the `_uScale` assigned would be correspond to the number of decimals of the `_vaultCurrency` assigned. 
This allow a caller to assign arbitrary number of decimals as an argument into the `_uScale` parameter and it may not correspond to the actual number of decimals of `_vaultCurrency`.

This lead to a bad situation that the number of decimals between a `_vaultCurrency` and `_uScale` within the  MainVault#`constructor()` may not correspond. 
As a result, the `exchangeRate` that the `_uScale` was assigned within the MainVault#`constructor()` may not correspond to the number of decimals of the `_vaultCurrency` assigned. 


## Impact
This vulnerability lead to the precision loss of the calculations within the MainVault#`deposit()` and  the MainVault#`withdraw()` like this:
- The `shares` received via the MainVault#`deposit()` will be smaller or larger than the `actual shares` that is supposed to be received. 
- The amount of the `vaultCurrency` (i.e. USDC) received via the MainVault#`withdraw()` will be smaller or larger than the `actual amount` of the `vaultCurrency` that is supposed to be received.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a input validation to the MainVault#`constructor()` in order to check whether or not the `_uScale` assigned would be correspond to the number of decimals of the `_vaultCurrency` assigned like his:
```solidity
  constructor(
    string memory _name,
    string memory _symbol,
    uint8 _decimals,
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    address _dao,
    address _game,
    address _controller,
    address _vaultCurrency,
    uint256 _uScale
  )
    VaultToken(_name, _symbol, _decimals)
    Vault(_vaultNumber, _dao, _controller, _vaultCurrency, _uScale)
  {
+   require(_uScale == 10**IERC20(_vaultCurrency).decimals(), "_uScale must be equal to the number of decimals of the _vaultCurrency");
    exchangeRate = _uScale;
    ...
  }
```
