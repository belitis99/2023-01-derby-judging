# No check for valid address when setting Guardian

## Summary
There are no checks when setting the Guardian address whether the address is valid

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
/// @notice Setter for guardian address
  /// @param _guardian new address of the guardian
  function setGuardian(address _guardian) external onlyDao {
    guardian = _guardian;
  }
```
The set guardian function does not check whether the `_guardian` argument is a zero address, therefore the `guardian` could be accidentally or deliberately set to the zero address.

## Impact
Setting the guardian to the zero address could make the contract unusable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
require that the `_guardian` argument is not the zero address

```solidity
  /// @notice Setter for guardian address
  /// @param _guardian new address of the guardian
  function setGuardian(address _guardian) external onlyDao {
    require(_guardian != address(0), "Guardian cannot be 0 address");
    guardian = _guardian;
  }
```
