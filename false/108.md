# MainVault.checkForBalance can decrease withdraw amount up to 1$

## Summary
MainVault.checkForBalance can decrease withdraw amount up to 1$
## Vulnerability Detail
When user wants to withdraw his withdraw request or rewards, then `checkForBalance` function [is called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L172). This function check that balance of vault is enough to cover amount to withdraw. And in case if it's not, it allows balance to be less than `maxDivergenceWithdraws` maximum.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L238-L245
```solidity
  function checkForBalance(uint256 _value) internal view returns (uint256) {
    if (_value > getVaultBalance()) {
      uint256 oldValue = _value;
      _value = getVaultBalance();
      require(oldValue - _value <= maxDivergenceWithdraws, "Max divergence");
    }
    return _value;
  }
```
Currently `maxDivergenceWithdraws` is 1million, which is 1$ in USDC token.
Because of that withdrawer can receive 1$ less if not enough balance inside vault.

And also this unpaid value is not stored anywhere, so user can receive it in future.
## Impact
User lose part of funds.

## Recommendation
In case if you pay user less, then should, you can store that shortage inside some variable for future payment.
