# The caller (`msg.sender`) may lose the principles (`vaultCurrency`) due to that an `arbitrary address` can be assigned into the MainVault#`transferFunds()` within the MainVault#`withdraw()`

## Summary
Due to that an `arbitrary address` can be assigned into the MainVault#`transferFunds()` via the MainVault#`withdraw()`, the caller (`msg.sender`) may lose the principles (`vaultCurrency`) when the MainVault#`withdraw()` would be called by the caller (`msg.sender`).

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the MainVault#`withdraw()`, 
the `_receiver` would be assigned as a parameter.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L133
And then, two functions would be internally called like this: 
- the VaultToken#`_burn()` would be called to burn the `_amount` of LP tokens that `msg.sender` holds.
   https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L142
- the MainVault#`transferFunds()` would be called to transfer the `value` of VaultCurrency from the Vault to `_receiver`.
    https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L143
```solidity
  /// @notice Withdraw from Vault
  /// @dev Withdraw VaultCurrency from Vault and burn LP tokens
  /// @param _amount Amount to withdraw in LP tokens
  /// @param _receiver Receiving address for the vaultcurrency
  /// @return value Amount received by seller in vaultCurrency
  function withdraw(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver, /// @audit
    address _owner
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());
    ...

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);      /// @audit
    transferFunds(_receiver, value);  /// @audit
  }
```

Within the MainVault#` transferFunds()`,
the `value` of VaultCurrency that the `govFee` is deducted would be transferred from the Vault to `_receiver` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L188
```solidity
  /// @notice Substract governance fee from value
  /// @param _receiver Receiving adress for the vaultcurrency
  /// @param _value Amount received by seller in vaultCurrency
  function transferFunds(address _receiver, uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 govFee = (_value * governanceFee) / 10_000;

    vaultCurrency.safeTransfer(getDao(), govFee);
    vaultCurrency.safeTransfer(_receiver, _value - govFee);  /// @audit
  }
```

On the assumption that, within the MainVault#`withdraw()`, the user address who the LP tokens are burned is supposed to correspond to the user address who receive the principles (`vaultCurrency`).

However, these addresses can be different because of that within the MainVault#`withdraw()`, the `_receiver` that is an `arbitrary address` can be assigned into the MainVault#`transferFunds()`.

This lead to a bad situation that the despite the caller (`msg.sender`) call the MainVault#`withdraw()` and then their LP tokens would be burned, the caller (`msg.sender`) cannot receive the principles (`vaultCurrency`).


## Impact
When the MainVault#`withdraw()` would be called by the caller (`msg.sender`), the caller (`msg.sender`) may lose the principles (`vaultCurrency`).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing the `_receiver` from the parameters of the MainVault#`withdraw()`. 
And then, consider assigning the `msg.sender` into the the MainVault#`transferFunds()` within the MainVault#`withdraw()` instead of `arbitrary address` like this:
```solidity
  function withdraw(
    uint256 _amount,
-   address _receiver,
    address _owner
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());
    ...

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);      
+   transferFunds(msg.sender, value);
-   transferFunds(_receiver, value);
  }
```
