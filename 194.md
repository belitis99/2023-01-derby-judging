# Failure to Check Transfer Success in Withdraw Function Can Result in Loss of tTokens.

## Summary
The withdraw function in "IdlePrvider" contract does not verify whether the transfer of `tTokens` from the caller to the contract was successful or not.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the withdraw function in the following line of code:
```solidity
      IIdle(_iToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount) == true,
```
The function does not check whether the transfer of `tTokens` from the caller to the contract was successful, If the transfer fails, the contract will still attempt to redeem the `tTokens` and send the underlying tokens back to the caller, resulting in the caller losing their `tTokens` without receiving any underlying tokens.
It pulls `tTokens` from the caller, redeems them from Idle, and sends the underlying asset back to the caller.

The function takes three arguments as follows: `_amount`, `_iToken`, and `_uToken`. `_amount` represents the amount of `tTokens` to be redeemed; `_iToken` represents the address of the protocol LP Token; `_uToken` represents the address of the underlying Token.

The code of the withdraw function:
```solidity
  function withdraw(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _iToken,
    address _uToken
  ) external override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(msg.sender);


    uint256 balanceBeforeRedeem = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(address(this));


    require(
      IIdle(_iToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount) == true,
      "Error: transferFrom"
    );
    IIdle(_iToken).redeemIdleToken(_amount);


    uint256 balanceAfterRedeem = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 uTokensReceived = balanceAfterRedeem - balanceBeforeRedeem;


    IERC20(_uToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, uTokensReceived);


    uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(msg.sender);
    require(
      (balanceAfter - balanceBefore - uTokensReceived) == 0,
      "Error Withdraw: under/overflow"
    );


    return uTokensReceived;
  }
```
The first line of the function gets the balance of `_uToken` of the caller before the function is executed, and the next line gets the balance of `_uToken` in the contract before the `tTokens` are redeemed.

The function then calls `IIdle(_iToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount)`, which transfers `_amount` of `tTokens` from the caller to the contract. 
However, the function does not check if this transfer was successful or not. If the transfer fails, the function will still proceed, and the `tTokens` will not be redeemed.

The function then calls `IIdle(_iToken).redeemIdleToken(_amount)`, which redeems the `_amount` of `tTokens` from the Idle protocol. 
The resulting underlying tokens are stored in the contract.

The function then calculates the amount of underlying tokens received by subtracting the balance of `_uToken` in the contract before redemption from the balance after redemption, It then transfers the underlying tokens received to the caller.

The function then checks if the balance of `_uToken` of the caller after the function is executed is the same as the balance before the function plus the underlying tokens received. If this check fails, the function reverts with an error message.

If the transfer of `tTokens` from the caller to the contract fails, the function will still proceed with the redemption of `tTokens`, resulting in the underlying tokens being sent to the contract instead of the caller. This can result in a loss of funds for the caller. The caller may not even be aware that the transfer failed because the function does not provide any feedback on whether the transfer was successful or not.

Therefore, the withdraw function should be modified to include a check for the success of the transfer of tTokens from the caller to the contract. One way to achieve this is by using the require statement to check the return value

## Impact
As the `tTokens` transfer is not checked for success, it can result in `tTokens` not being transferred to the contract, which may result in `tTokens` loss. 
An attacker can exploit this by performing multiple withdrawal transactions that exhaust `tTokens`, which will result in a total depletion of `tTokens`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
* Use the "require" statement to check if the transfer of `tTokens` from the caller to the contract was successful or not.
* Revert the transaction if the `tTokens` transfer is not successful.
```solidity
  function withdraw(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _iToken,
    address _uToken
  ) external override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(msg.sender);

    uint256 balanceBeforeRedeem = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(address(this));

  + require(
  +   IERC20(_iToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount) == true,
  +   "Error: transferFrom"
  + );
    
    require(
      IIdle(_iToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount) == true,
      "Error: tToken transferFrom"
    );
    
    IIdle(_iToken).redeemIdleToken(_amount);

    uint256 balanceAfterRedeem = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 uTokensReceived = balanceAfterRedeem - balanceBeforeRedeem;

    IERC20(_uToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, uTokensReceived);

    uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(_uToken).balanceOf(msg.sender);
    require(
      (balanceAfter - balanceBefore - uTokensReceived) == 0,
      "Error Withdraw: under/overflow"
    );

    return uTokensReceived;
  }
