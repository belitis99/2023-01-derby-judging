# User can't create more than 1 withdraw request

## Summary
User can't create more than 1 withdraw request. In case if user have changed his mind, he can't withdraw more tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
`MainVault.withdrawalRequest` allows user to create request to withdraw funds after next rebalance.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L149-L162
```solidity
  function withdrawalRequest(
    uint256 _amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");


    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());


    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);


    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
    totalWithdrawalRequests += value;
  }
```
As you can see if `user.withdrawalRequestPeriod != 0`, then he is not allowed to create new request. In other words, once you have not withdrawn request, you can't create new one.

This creates some problems for users as they need to wait till next rebalance(up to 14 days) in order to withdraw that request. User can't withdraw more, however there is no reasons for that. 
If you look into `withdraw` function, then you will see, that users are not limited for the amount they can withdraw(in case if funds available). The same should be implemented for the withdraw requests(currently users set that limit by their first withdraw request).

Example.
1.User has 10_000 vault tokens, he decided to withdraw 8_000, but there is only 1_000 available now,
2.So he created request to withdraw 8_000 tokens. Till rebalancing he needs to wait 10 days.
3.After 1 day he realized that he needs to withdraw all his 10_000.
4.There is no ability for him to create additional request.
## Impact
User can't withdraw more funds in same rebalancing period, once they have created one withdraw request.

## Recommendation
I guess there is no need to limit withdraw requests. Just allow user to create additional request.
