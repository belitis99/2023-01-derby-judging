# Use safeTransferFrom instead of transferFrom in XProvider

## Summary
Using unsafe ERC20 methods can revert the transaction for certain tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
For example, IERC20(token).transferFrom() and IERC20(token).transfer() will fail for some tokens as they may not conform to the standard IERC20 interface.
## Impact
The contract will malfunction for certain tokens.

Even if using SafeERC20 for IERC20 is added, it is still required to call the safe version of the function:
