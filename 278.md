# YearnProtocol’s pricePerShare can return wrong exchangeRate by the use of flash-loans

## Summary

YearnProtocol’s `pricePerShare` can be manipulated by directly depositing into the underlying pool which can significantly manipulate the price. This has been previously exploited using flash loan to exploit CREAM Finance ([https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/blob/master/disclosures/2021-10-27.md](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/blob/master/disclosures/2021-10-27.md)) 

## Vulnerability Detail

The value of `pricePerShare` can be significantly increased, the value is calculated using `totalAssets / totalSupply` . Here the totalAssets can be increased by directly depositing into the vault., hence the value of `pricePerShare` can be increased. 

This will directly affect the functions `exchangeRate` (for the provider) and `price` (in Vault.sol), which will now return wrong price.

This can then affect the `rewardPerLockedToken` mapping due to the value of `nominator` being significantly larger.

```solidity
function storePriceAndRewards(uint256 _totalUnderlying, uint256 _protocolId) internal {
    uint256 currentPrice = price(_protocolId); // calculated from pricePerShare
    if (lastPrices[_protocolId] == 0) {
      lastPrices[_protocolId] = currentPrice;
      return;
    }

    int256 priceDiff = int256(currentPrice - lastPrices[_protocolId]);
    int256 nominator = (int256(_totalUnderlying * performanceFee) * priceDiff);
    int256 totalAllocatedTokensRounded = totalAllocatedTokens / 1E18;
    int256 denominator = totalAllocatedTokensRounded * int256(lastPrices[_protocolId]) * 100; // * 100 cause perfFee is in percentages

    if (totalAllocatedTokensRounded == 0) {
      rewardPerLockedToken[rebalancingPeriod][_protocolId] = 0;
    } else {
      rewardPerLockedToken[rebalancingPeriod][_protocolId] = nominator / denominator;
    }

    lastPrices[_protocolId] = currentPrice;
  }
```

## Impact

This might lead to fund loss depending on the liquidity present in the vault as the price will return different value than it should.

## Recommendation

Here are a few comments/recommendation that can be taken in consideration:

1. Strictly check the price source for all tokens - you should be confident that no element in the formula can be manipulated. 
2. Use the Chainlink oracle. 
3. Use TWAP when the Chainlink price is not available (but it is bad advice in some cases, see the following chapter).
