# IdleProvider overstates balanceUnderlying() and understates calcShares()

## Summary

IdleProvider's exchangeRate() use Idle's tokenPrice() which doesn't include performance based fees, so balanceUnderlying() and calcShares() report figures that may not match with what Vault will effectively obtain on interaction with Idle.

## Vulnerability Detail

Idle has abstract tokenPrice() and user-dependent tokenPriceWithFee(), which takes into account performance fees.

tokenPrice(), which do not have user information and report price excluding any performance fees, isn't a correct way to estimate current balance with Idle pool and the quantity of shares needed to withdraw a particular amount of underlying, tokenPriceWithFee() is.

## Impact

IdleProvider overstates balance of underlying and understates the number of shares needed to withdraw given amount of underlying.

This will skew rebalancing as result of it will be less than requested whenever Idle strategy obtained a profit and will have performance fees deducted on withdrawal. This will bias the distribution vs expected and can lead to protocol-wide losses accumulated over time.

Also, Derby internal performance metric is inflated this way for Idle pools as the same no-fee rate is used to gauge it.

## Code Snippet

IdleProvider returns tokenPrice() in exchangeRate():

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/IdleProvider.sol#L113-L118

```solidity
  /// @notice Exchange rate of underyling protocol token
  /// @param _iToken Address of protocol LP Token eg yUSDC
  /// @return price of LP token
  function exchangeRate(address _iToken) public view override returns (uint256) {
    return IIdle(_iToken).tokenPrice();
  }
```

It is then used for balance of underlying and shares per amount of underlying estimations:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/IdleProvider.sol#L79-L103

```solidity
  /// @notice Get balance from address in underlying token
  /// @dev balance = poolvalue * shares / totalsupply
  /// @param _address Address to request balance from, most likely an Vault
  /// @param _iToken Address of protocol LP Token eg cUSDC
  /// @return balance in underlying token
  function balanceUnderlying(
    address _address,
    address _iToken
  ) public view override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balanceShares = balance(_address, _iToken);
    uint256 price = exchangeRate(_iToken);
    uint256 decimals = IERC20Metadata(IIdle(_iToken).token()).decimals();
    return (balanceShares * price) / 10 ** decimals;
  }

  /// @notice Calculates how many shares are equal to the amount
  /// @dev shares = totalsupply * balance / poolvalue
  /// @param _amount Amount in underyling token e.g USDC
  /// @param _iToken Address of protocol LP Token eg cUSDC
  /// @return number of shares i.e LP tokens
  function calcShares(uint256 _amount, address _iToken) external view override returns (uint256) {
    uint256 decimals = IERC20Metadata(IIdle(_iToken).token()).decimals();
    uint256 shares = (_amount * (10 ** decimals)) / exchangeRate(_iToken);
    return shares;
  }
```

However, Idle has substantial enough performance fees (10% and higher), which are removed from a profit generated for a particular user.

https://docs.idle.finance/developers/best-yield/methods/tokenprice

https://docs.idle.finance/developers/best-yield/methods/tokenpricewithfee

```md
This method returns $IDLE token price for a specific user considering fees, in underlying. This is useful when you need to redeem exactly X amount of underlying tokens.
```

This way tokenPrice() isn't a correct way for a Vault to estimate what will be obtained from Idle as it overstates share price not including the fees due.

balanceUnderlying() and calcShares() are used in Vault rebalancing, for example:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L178-L192

```solidity
  function rebalanceCheckProtocols(
    uint256 _newTotalUnderlying
  ) internal returns (uint256[] memory) {
    uint256[] memory protocolToDeposit = new uint[](controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber));
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      bool isBlacklisted = controller.getProtocolBlacklist(vaultNumber, i);

      storePriceAndRewards(_newTotalUnderlying, i);

      if (isBlacklisted) continue;
      setAllocation(i);

      int256 amountToProtocol = calcAmountToProtocol(_newTotalUnderlying, i);
      uint256 currentBalance = balanceUnderlying(i);
```

exchangeRate() is also used in Vault's price() for measuring performance, which is overstated this way for Idle:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L381-L390

```solidity
  /// @notice Get price for underlying protocol
  /// @param _protocolNum Protocol number linked to an underlying protocol e.g compound_usdc_01
  /// @return protocolPrice Price per lp token
  function price(uint256 _protocolNum) public view returns (uint256) {
    IController.ProtocolInfoS memory protocol = controller.getProtocolInfo(
      vaultNumber,
      _protocolNum
    );
    return IProvider(protocol.provider).exchangeRate(protocol.LPToken);
  }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using `tokenPriceWithFee(msg.sender)` for expected amounts:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/IdleProvider.sol#L113-L118

```solidity
  /// @notice Exchange rate of underyling protocol token
  /// @param _iToken Address of protocol LP Token eg yUSDC
  /// @return price of LP token
  function exchangeRate(address _iToken) public view override returns (uint256) {
-   return IIdle(_iToken).tokenPrice();
+   return IIdle(_iToken).tokenPriceWithFee(msg.sender);
  }
```
