# M-12 The protocol will set wrong allocations to a chain without the protocol

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In case the vault has only one protocol on it, which gets blacklisted over time by [blacklistProtocol()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L477-L483).
The **Guardian** should be able to set the value of `vaults[_vaultNumber].currentAllocationPerChain[_chainId]` of this chain to `zero` on `xChainController`.
In order to keep the protocol working properly

## Impact
During the rebalancing, `xChainController` will `settleCurrentAllocation()` with wrong allocations, because allocations on the vault are `zero` but in `xChainController` are `> 0`
 This will lead to locking some funds in the vault every period
