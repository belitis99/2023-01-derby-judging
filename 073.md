# No check for valid address when setting xProvider

## Summary
There are no checks when setting the xProvider address whether the address is valid

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
/// @notice Setter for xProvider address
  /// @param _xProvider new address of xProvider on this chain
  function setXProvider(address _xProvider) external onlyDao {
    xProvider = _xProvider;
  }
```
The `setXProvider` function does not check whether the `_xProvider` argument is a zero address, therefore the `xProvider` could be accidentally or deliberately set to the zero address.

## Impact
Setting the xProvider to the zero address could make the contract unusable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
require that the `_xProvider` argument is not the zero address

```solidity

  /// @notice Setter for xProvider address
  /// @param _xProvider new address of xProvider on this chain
  function setXProvider(address _xProvider) external onlyDao {
    require(_xProvider != address(0), "Game: xProvider cannot be 0x0");
    xProvider = _xProvider;
  }
```
