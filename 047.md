# A malicious user can send rewards to a game indefinately by calling sendRewardsToGame() repeatedly.

## Summary
A malicious  can send rewards to a game indefinitely by calling ``sendRewardsToGame()`` repeatedly.  The vulnerability is that the rewards stored in ``rewardPerLockedToken`` is never consumed when ``sendRewardsToGame()`` is called. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The ``sendRewardsToGame()`` function allows one to push push ``rewardsPerLockedToken`` to a game. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L361-L370](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L361-L370)

It calls ``rewardsToArray()`` to retrieve the rewards from ``rewardPerLockedToken``. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L249-L256](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L249-L256)

However, both functions never consume  ``rewardPerLockedToken``. As a result, a malicious user can call ``sendRewardsToGame()`` repeatedly and drain the vault. There is no access control for the function, so this is allowed.  

## Impact
A malicious  can send rewards to a game indefinitely by calling ``sendRewardsToGame()`` repeatedly and drain the vault in rewards.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We need to consume  ``rewardPerLockedToken`` when calling  ``sendRewardsToGame()`` by resetting each element in ``rewardPerLockedToken`` to zero.

```diff
function sendRewardsToGame() external payable {
    require(state == State.SendRewardsPerToken, stateError);

    int256[] memory rewards = rewardsToArray();
    IXProvider(xProvider).pushRewardsToGame{value: msg.value}(vaultNumber, homeChain, rewards);

    state = State.Idle;
 
+  uint256 latestId = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);

+    for (uint256 i = 0; i < latestId; i++) {
+      rewardPerLockedToken[rebalancingPeriod][i] = 0;
+    }
 
    emit PushedRewardsToGame(vaultNumber, homeChain, rewards);
  }
```
