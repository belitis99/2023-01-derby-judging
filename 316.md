# If user got blacklisted , their funds can be permanently frozen.

## Summary
if the user is blacklisted after using the withdrawalRequest() function. User's funds can be permanently frozen inside the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
When users request withdraw with withdrawalRequest(), their lp token burns, and then they can use withdrawAllowance() to withdraw their funds. withdraw() function has a receiver address parameter, but withdrawAllowance() has not. If users are blacklisted by an asset contract, let's say it is USDC. They can't retrieve their funds with withdrawAllowance(), and their funds were permanently frozen inside the contract.
## Impact
backlisting is a low probability event, so setting the severity to be medium.

## Recommendation
Consider adding the receiver argument to the withdrawAllowance() function, so the balance beneficiary msg.sender can specify what address should receive the funds.
