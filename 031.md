# no reentrancy guard on mintNewBasket() function

## Summary
In Game.sol, the mintNewBasket() function calls _safeMint() which has a callback to the "to" address argument. Functions with callbacks should have reentrancy guards in place for protection against possible malicious actors both from inside and outside the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Game.sol, the mintNewBasket() function calls _safeMint() which has a callback to the "to" address argument. Functions with callbacks should have reentrancy guards in place for protection against possible malicious actors both from inside and outside the protocol.

mintNewBasket function is external and used for Mints a new NFT with a Basket of allocations and any user can call it. in this function, we make a call to the _safeMint function, another function from ERC721.

there should be a reentrancy guard on the _safeMint function because of a callback to the "to" address argument.

## Impact
Without a reentrancy guard, onERC721Received will allow an attacker controlled contract to call the mint again, which may not be desirable to some parties, like allowing minting more than allowed.
