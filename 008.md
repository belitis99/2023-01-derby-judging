# Initial Token Distribution

## Summary
In the constructor function of DerbyToken.sol, all _totalSupply tokens are minting to the deployer.

## Vulnerability Detail
All _totalSupply of Derby token can be sent to the contract deployer when deploying the contract. 

## Impact
All _totalSupply of Derby token can be sent to the contract deployer when deploying the contract. This is a potential centralization risk as the deployer can distribute Derby tokens without the consensus of the community.

I marked this as a Medium risk because this is a potential centralization risk and can destroy users' funds! You cannot guarantee that an EOA will not betray the project and its users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
recommend transparency by providing a breakdown of the intended initial token distribution in a public location. also, recommend the team make an effort to restrict the access of the corresponding private key.

Or transfer ownership of the DerbyToken contract to another contract and mint new tokens only if certain conditions get happened.
