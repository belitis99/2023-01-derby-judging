# MainVault.deposit can mint 0 shares

## Summary
MainVault.deposit can mint 0 shares and depositor will lose his deposited amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user deposits some amount of tokens, then they are [converted to shares](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L121) using `exchangeRate`.
Because there is no check, that received shares amount is bigger than 0, it's possible that user will lost deposited funds in case if deposited amount is less than price of 1 share.

Pls, note, that it's possible that `exchangeRate` will be less than `vaultCurrency.decimals` in case of losses inside any provider. As `exchangeRate` is calculated as [underlying of vault/total supply of shares](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/XChainController.sol#L307).

I believe that users should be protected from such cases and believe this is medium bug.
## Impact
