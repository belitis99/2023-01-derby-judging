# Change `derbyToken` in `Game.sol` could completely break a contract

## Summary
In contract `Game.sol` exists function `setDerbyToken((address _derbyToken)` with which invocation, and change `derbyToken` address could completely break a contract, because of using `balanceOf` and other `ERC20` functions through this contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `setDerbyToken` change the `derbyToken` address which could completely break a contract if it executes after initialization time.

## Impact
With the change `derbyToken` address after contract initialization, it will completely break the connection between the `Game` contract address, and the `derbyToken` address, so:
1. In function `lockTokensToBasket`, `balanceBefore` will be zero even if it was added `derbyToken` before
2. It will be impossible to unlock the previous `derbyToken`

Generally speaking, all calculations for lock/unlock derbyToken will be broken.

## Recommendation
Remove function `setDerbyToken` and add `immutable` keyword for storage variable `derbyToken`.
