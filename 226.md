# Adversary can drain tokens from ``claimTokens`` function (Vault.sol)

## Summary
this is because the ``claimTokens`` function has operations error and calls the ``claim`` function of the ``controller`` contract which has a re-entrancy issues.
## Vulnerability Detail
look at this code:
```solidity
function claimTokens() public {
    uint256 latestID = controller.latestProtocolId(vaultNumber);
    for (uint i = 0; i < latestID; i++) {
      if (currentAllocations[i] == 0) continue;
      bool claim = controller.claim(vaultNumber, i);
      if (claim) {
        address govToken = controller.getGovToken(vaultNumber, i);
        uint256 tokenBalance = IERC20(govToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        Swap.swapTokensMulti(
          Swap.SwapInOut(tokenBalance, govToken, address(vaultCurrency)),
          controller.getUniswapParams(),
          false
        );
      }
    }
  }
```
**Problem 1**: The loop is iterating up to the ``latestID``, but the loop is using `i` as the index. This means that it will skip the last element in the array. 

**Problem 2**: The function does not check if there are any elements in ``currentAllocations`` before attempting to iterate through them. 

**Problem 1 and 2 make it possible for anyone to claim the token**

**Problem 3**: is re-entrancy issues when ``claimTokens`` function call  ``claim`` function of the ``controller`` contract
see this:
```solidity
function claim(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint256 _protocolNumber
  ) external override onlyVault returns (bool) {
    if (claimable[protocolInfo[_vaultNumber][_protocolNumber].LPToken]) {
      return
        IProvider(protocolInfo[_vaultNumber][_protocolNumber].provider).claim(
          protocolInfo[_vaultNumber][_protocolNumber].LPToken,
          msg.sender
        );
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
```
from ``Provider`` contract here:
```solidity 
function claim(address _tToken, address _claimer) external override returns(bool) {
  }
```
lines ``61-66`` of the code are not checked for errors and returns,
so there is only at the end an undefined false return, means if it is ``false`` anyone can call it again and return ``true``

## Impact
The ``rebalance`` function is also affected by a bug in the ``claimTokens`` function. 
Adversary can claim tokens they don't have and also drain tokens from ``Vault``.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Solution 1: Change the condition of the for loop to ``i <= latestID``. 
Solution 2: Add an if statement before the for loop to check if ``currentAllocations`` is empty or not.
solution 3: Add an require statement in function ``claim``
