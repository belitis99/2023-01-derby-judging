# Non-Reverting Token Transfer in redeemNegativeRewards Function

## Summary
The smart has a vulnerability in the `redeemNegativeRewards` function due to the lack of input validation checks and the possibility of non-reverting token transfers in case of failure, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to steal tokens from the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `redeemNegativeRewards` function due to the lack of input validation checks and the possibility of non-reverting token transfers in case of failure.

The specific line of code where the vulnerability occurs is in the `redeemNegativeRewards` function:
```solidity
 IERC20(derbyToken).safeTransfer(homeVault, tokensToBurn);
```
If the transfer of `tokensToBurn` fails, the function does not revert.

The function `redeemNegativeRewards` is designed to calculate the negative rewards for a given basket of tokens and burn them. However, there is a vulnerability due to the lack of input validation checks and the possibility of non-reverting token transfers in case of failure.

Here's how the function works:

1. It takes two parameters `_basketId` is the ID of the basket of tokens, and `_unlockedTokens` is the number of tokens to unlock and send to the user.
2. It checks if there are any `unredeemed` rewards for the basket If the total `unredeemed` rewards are greater than the negative reward threshold, it returns 0 (no tokens to burn).
3. If there are negative rewards, it calculates the number of tokens to burn based on the formula `(uint(-unredeemedRewards) * negativeRewardFactor) / 100`. The `negativeRewardFactor` is an approximation of the price of the tokens, and the formula calculates the number of tokens to burn as a percentage of the negative rewards.
4. It then burns the calculated number of tokens by transferring them to the `homeVault` address using the `safeTransfer` function of the `derbyToken` ERC-20 token contract.
5. It returns the number of tokens burned.

The vulnerability in this function is that it does not perform input validation checks, and it does not revert the transaction if the token transfer fails. 

This can lead to several issues.

1. If `_basketId` is invalid, the function will still execute and return a value, this can lead to incorrect results in other parts of the code that rely on the function's output.
2. If `_unlockedTokens` is greater than the number of tokens in the basket, the function will still execute, but it will burn more tokens than are available, resulting in a negative balance in the "derbyToken" contract.
3. If the token transfer to `homeVault` fails for any reason (e.g., insufficient gas, a bug in the "derbyToken" contract), the function will not revert the transaction, resulting in a loss of tokens.

## Impact
An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to burn a significant amount of tokens or even steal all tokens from the smart contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The function should perform input validation checks to ensure that the values of `_basketId` and `_unlockedTokens` are valid and revert the transaction if the transfer of tokens fails. 
Additionally, it may be helpful to log events or emit error messages to provide more information in case of a failure.
