# rewardsAllowance overwrite leads to loss of rewards

## Summary
A variable rewardAllowance is used in MainVault to track rewards available for a user to withdraw. This allowance is overwritten at each redeeming (if amount to redeem != 0), so a user may lose rewards not withdrawn from vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Game.sol, redeemRewards is defined as:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L545-L553

calling redeemRewardsGame on MainVault.sol:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L194-L204

where `user.rewardAllowance = _value` resets rewardAllowance to the new value.

We can see that if the basket owner follows scenario:
- redeemRewards on Game 
- does not withdraw rewards from Vault
- redeems again on Game

His first redeemed rewards are lost, because rewardAllowance is overwritten by the new value

## Impact
Basket owners lose rewards

## Recommendation
Do not overwrite rewardAllowance but add the new value to it;
