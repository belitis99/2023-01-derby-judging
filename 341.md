# MainVault.sol : sendRewardsToGame is harmed for re-entrancy attack

## Summary
`MainVault.sol#L361` - `sendRewardsToGame()` , sends the rewards to game by collecting the rewards from `rewardsToArray()`.
This is done when state is `State.SendRewardsPerToken`.

sendRewardsToGame is calling the `pushRewardsToGame()` in` XProvider.sol`. Here, rewards are sent based on chain type(home or foreign)

When rewards is sent to home chain, it is updated in `mapping(uint32 => mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => int256))) rewardPerLockedToken;` in the function [settleRewardsInt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L512).

If it is in another chain, the control is given outside which is making possibility for re-entrancy.

Note : State.Idle is set after calling the `pushRewardsToGame`

## Vulnerability Detail
Refer the summary section.

## Impact

1. accumulation of rewards to one specify vault. This eventually lead to loss of the fund in the contract. All funds will be as rewards.
2. Loss of funds if it is going outside of home chain. Again draining out the funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Add non - renetrant modifier.
2. set `state = State.Idle;` after checking for `State.SendRewardsPerToken`
