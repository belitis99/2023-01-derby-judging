# withdrawRewards vulnerable to sandwich attacks

## Summary
Anybody can call `withdrawRewards` on MainVault to claim rewards for a protocol, but by doing so some amount of reward tokens are swapped in uniswap. A malicious user can manipulate the price to steal rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

as we see in :
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L208-L231

the amount out is determined using the quote for the current block:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/libraries/Swap.sol#L74

A malicious user can sandwich the transaction of a legitimate user:
- move the price of the pool in uniswap
- call `withdrawRewards` (which uses the quoter to get the quote after manipulation)
- move the price of the pool back, taking a share of the rewards in gov tokens

## Impact
Theft of rewards from the protocol

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a twap price source to determine acceptable amount out.
