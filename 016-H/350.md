# Possible reentrancy during `_safeMint` in `mintNewBasket`

## Summary
Possible reentrancy during `_safeMint` in `mintNewBasket`.

## Vulnerability Detail
[`_safeMint`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Game.sol#L259) function ensures that the target handles the minted NFT.
If the target is a contract, the `_checkOnERC721Received` is called which enables to call other functions of the Derby protocol before the end of the `mintNewBasket` function.

## Impact
Currently the only value that is changed / affected by this reentrancy is `latestBasketId`.
`latestBasketId` is incremented after the minting.
Not any code aside `minNewBasket` uses this variable.

However if any code added relies on the `latestBasketId` it may cause damages.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function mintNewBasket(uint256 _vaultNumber) external returns (uint256) { 
    // mint Basket with nrOfUnAllocatedTokens equal to _lockedTokenAmount
    baskets[latestBasketId].vaultNumber = _vaultNumber;
    baskets[latestBasketId].lastRebalancingPeriod = vaults[_vaultNumber].rebalancingPeriod + 1;
    _safeMint(msg.sender, latestBasketId); //@audit _checkOnERC721Received on the target is called here 
    latestBasketId++; //@audit this variable is updated after the NFT minting

    emit BasketId(msg.sender, latestBasketId - 1);
    return latestBasketId - 1;
  }
``` 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Follow the Check Effect Interact pattern updating the `latestBasketId` value before minting the NFT.
