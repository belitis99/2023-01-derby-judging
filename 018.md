# Unsafe ERC20 transfer/transferFrom can result in stuck funds

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return false. 
tranfser/transferfrom is directly used to send tokens in many places in the contract and the return value is not checked.
If the token send fails, it will cause a lot of serious problems.
## Impact
The issue is that the code doesn't use the safeTransferFrom() utility from SafeERC20.
Therefore, profitTokens that don't return a bool in transferFrom() will cause a revert which
means they are stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/BetaProvider.sol#L37
`    IBeta(_bToken).transfer(msg.sender, tTokensReceived);`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/CompoundProvider.sol#L45
`    ICToken(_cToken).transfer(msg.sender, cTokensReceived);`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Providers/IdleProvider.sol#L39
`    IIdle(_iToken).transfer(msg.sender, tTokensReceived);`

`ITruefi(_tToken).transfer(msg.sender, tTokensReceived);`

```solidity
147:     IERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
150:     IERC20(_token).approve(address(connext), _amount);
329:     IERC20(_asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, xController, _amount);
372:     IERC20(_asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, _vault, _amount);
574:     IERC20(_token).transfer(xController, balance);
583:     IERC20(_token).transfer(vault, balance);
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
