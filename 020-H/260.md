# The ````exchangeRate()```` of ````CompoundProvider.sol```` is not implemented properly

## Summary
The ````exchangeRate()```` of other providers except ````CompoundProvider```` is calculated relying on the current rate, the outcome would  be precise.
But ````CompoundProvider```` uses ````exchangeRateStored()```` which is a snapshot value of the latest update. the ````_price ```` would not be a real time value.

```solidity
File: derby-yield-optimiser\contracts\Providers\CompoundProvider.sol
126:   function exchangeRate(address _cToken) public view override returns (uint256) {
127:     uint256 _price = ICToken(_cToken).exchangeRateStored();
128:     return _price;
129:   }
```

## Vulnerability Detail
Considering the large amount of funds may be involved, errors here can lead to significant errors in other processes within the system, such as ````rebalance()```` and ````withdrawFromProtocol()````.
To give an example, let's say
the deposited funds in Compound pool is worth
```solidity
fundInUSD = $100M
```
and the APY is
```solidity
APY = 10%
```
the last snapshot is 1 hour ago
```solidity
TIME = 3600 secs
```
then we can estimate the error as
```solidity
errorInUSD = fundInUSD * APY * TIME / secondsOfAYear = 100M * 10% * 3600 / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60) = $1141
```
It's not a negligible value, especially when the vault tries to withdraw all fund from Compound.
## Impact
This issue may cause some processes within the system are not precise.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
replace ````exchangeRateStored()```` with ````exchangeRateCurrent()````
```diff
File: derby-yield-optimiser\contracts\Providers\CompoundProvider.sol
126:   function exchangeRate(address _cToken) public view override returns (uint256) {
-127:     uint256 _price = ICToken(_cToken).exchangeRateStored();
+         uint256 _price = ICToken(_cToken).exchangeRateCurrent();
128:     return _price;
129:   }

```
