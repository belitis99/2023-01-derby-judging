# Rebalance can fail due to negative allocation calculation.

## Summary
When delta allocations decrease the current allocation below 0 the rebalance of a vault will revert. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `setAllocation()` function of the `vault` contract a require statement checks whether the resulting `currentAllocation` is not a negative value. 
```solidity
  function setAllocation(uint256 _i) internal {
    currentAllocations[_i] += deltaAllocations[_i];
    deltaAllocations[_i] = 0;
    require(currentAllocations[_i] >= 0, "Allocation underflow");
  }
```
This function is called during a rebalance call which will thus fail. To rectify this the delta allocation will have to be modified so that the calculation returns a positive number. 
It's better to just set the `currentAllocation` to 0 when this happens. as this means the underlying tokens will be pulled from the protocol.

It is also noteworthy that the `currentAllocations` [mapping](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L68) is defined as signed integers seemingly indicating negative values are allowed, although this does not make sense as it represent the wanted allocation in a protocol.
```solidity
  mapping(uint256 => int256) internal currentAllocations;
```

## Impact
Rebalancing can fail and the guardian will have to set the delta allocations to values that don't result in negative current allocations.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either replace the `require` by setting the current allocation to 0 or move the check to to the `receiveProtocolAllocationsInt()` function. 
Also consider changing the mapping to a `uint256` to indicate the requirement of a positive number.
