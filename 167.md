# If the vault have enough funds available, users may also only be able to withdraw assets on the next rebalancing  period

## Summary
If the vault have enough funds available, user accidentally submits a  withdrawal request, he can only withdraw the asset on the next rebalancing period.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ```withdrawalRequest()``` function is used to withdrawal request for when the vault doesnt have enough funds available. However, if the vault have enough funds available, user accidentally submits a  withdrawal request, he can only withdraw the asset on the next rebalancing period.

```solidity
function withdrawalRequest(
    uint256 _amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");

    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);

    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
    totalWithdrawalRequests += value;
  }
```

## Impact
If the vault have enough funds available, user accidentally submits a  withdrawal request, he can only withdraw the asset on the next rebalancing period.
