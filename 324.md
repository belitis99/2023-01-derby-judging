# COMP reward token swapping path is not efficient, causing reduced yield

## Summary
When selling COMP token rewards, the swapping path is not efficient: ETH has to be sold in a pool with the swapping fee of 0.3%, which is 6 times higher than the swapping fee of the pool with the highest liquidity (0.05%). If the 0.05% pool is used to seel ETH, then a malicious actor can deploy a COMP/ETH pool with the fee of 0.05% to manipulate the price and steal rewards.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol integrates with third-party vaults (e.g. Aave, Compound, Yearn, etc.), in which it deposits user funds to generate yield. Some of the third-party vaults (at the moment, only Compound) reward their users with protocol tokens (COMP, in the case of Compound). These tokens can be claimed and sold for the underlying token of the vaults (e.g. USDC):
1. [during rebalancing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L141);
1. at any moment by calling [claimTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L404).

The [Swap.swapTokensMulti](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/libraries/Swap.sol#L64) function, which is responsible for selling tokens on Uniswap, uses the following [path](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/libraries/Swap.sol#L72) when selling a reward token (the current implementation only supports COMP) for the underlying token (USDC):
```solidity
_swap.tokenIn, _uniswap.poolFee, WETH, _uniswap.poolFee, _swap.tokenOut
```

I.e. COMP is first sold for WETH, and WETH is then sold for USDC. The path consists of two swaps and thus two Uniswap pools will be involved. However, the path uses the same pool fee for both swaps: `_uniswap.poolFee`. At the moment of the audit, the [WETH/USDC pool with highest TVL is the one with the fee of 0.05%](https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2). However, there's no COMP/WETH pool with this fee: there are only [COMP/ETH pools with fees 0.3% and 1%](https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0xc00e94cb662c3520282e6f5717214004a7f26888). This means that the protocol will have to use 0.3% fee for both swaps and WETH will be sold for USDC with a 6 times higher swap fee.
## Impact
Due to inefficient selling of COMP tokens, proceedings are lower than they could be. In the long term, selling COMP rewards will result in lower yield than allowed by on-chain conditions.
## Code Snippet
1. `ClaimTokens` sells the reward token for the underlying token:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L404
1. `ClaimToken` is called during rebalancing:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L141
1. The proceedings from selling reward tokens increase the total number of underlying tokens during rebalancing:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L158-L164
1. `Swap.swapTokensMulti` performs on-chain slippage tolerance calculation, which is vulnerable to price manipulation:

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Short term, consider having two Uniswap pool swap fee parameters that can be independently set to different values.

Long term, to support new reward tokens, consider using custom paths per each reward token and consider letting the DAO pick the most optimal swap path for each reward token.
