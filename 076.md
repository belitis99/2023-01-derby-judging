# No check for valid address when setting Vault address by Guardian

## Summary
There are no checks when setting the vault address whether the address is valid

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
  /// @notice setter to link a chainId to a vault address for cross chain functions
  function setVaultAddress(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint32 _chainId,
    address _address
  ) external onlyGuardian {
    vaults[_vaultNumber].vaultAddress[_chainId] = _address;
  }
```
The `setVaultAddress` function does not check whether the `_address` argument is a zero address, therefore the `setVaultAddress` could be accidentally or deliberately set to the zero address.

## Impact
Setting the VaultAddress to the zero address could make the contract unusable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
require that the `_address` argument is not the zero address

```solidity
/// @notice setter to link a chainId to a vault address for cross chain functions
  function setVaultAddress(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint32 _chainId,
    address _address
  ) external onlyGuardian {
    require(_address != address(0), "Vault address cannot be 0");
    vaults[_vaultNumber].vaultAddress[_chainId] = _address;
  }
```
