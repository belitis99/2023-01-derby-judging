# Vault.rebalance calculates rewards per locked token incorrectly

## Summary
Vault.rebalance calculates rewards per locked token incorrectly, because it calls `settleDeltaAllocation` function, which updates `totalAllocatedTokens` variable with new allocations, before `storePriceAndRewards` function, which calculates rewards based on `totalAllocatedTokens` amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
Function `storePriceAndRewards` is responsible for calculating rewards per locked token for provider.
To calculate rewards [it uses `totalAllocatedTokens` variable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L235). This variable should be allocated amount for previous period.

Function `storePriceAndRewards` is called inside `rebalanceCheckProtocols` function, which [is called inside `rebalance`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L145) function.
The problem is that before `rebalanceCheckProtocols` function, the `settleDeltaAllocation` function is called and this function is actually [updates `totalAllocatedTokens` with new allocations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L168).

This is the problem as `storePriceAndRewards` function should calculate rewards based on `totalAllocatedTokens` amount for previous period, but because `settleDeltaAllocation` is called before, `totalAllocatedTokens` amount corresponds to the new period and calculations are incorrect.
## Impact
Rewards for all reward cycles are incorrect.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You need to calculate rewards before changing `totalAllocatedTokens` variable.
