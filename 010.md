# Reward token payouts can be sandwiched and user rewards stolen

## Summary
[`MainVault.withdrawRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L208) can swap user rewards to the DAO token before paying them to the user. The contract does not check for the pool to be manipulated, allowing for the swap to be sandwiched and thus the user rewards to be stolen.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user withdraws his rewards, [`MainVault.withdrawRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L208) can swap the rewards to the DAO token using Uniswap V3 before sending the resulting tokens to the user.

The function first calculates the expected output amount from the current on-chain pool state:
```solidity
// libraries/Swap.sol @ function swapTokensMulti
uint256 amountOutMinimum = IQuoter(_uniswap.quoter).quoteExactInput(
     abi.encodePacked(_swap.tokenIn, _uniswap.poolFee, WETH, _uniswap.poolFee, _swap.tokenOut),
    _swap.amount
);
```

and then swaps the tokens:
```solidity
// libraries/Swap.sol @ function swapTokensMulti
ISwapRouter.ExactInputParams memory params = ISwapRouter.ExactInputParams({
      path: abi.encodePacked(
        _swap.tokenIn,
        _uniswap.poolFee,
        WETH,
        _uniswap.poolFee,
        _swap.tokenOut
    ),
    recipient: address(this),
    deadline: block.timestamp,
    amountIn: _swap.amount,
    amountOutMinimum: amountOutMinimum
});

ISwapRouter(_uniswap.router).exactInput(params);
uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(_swap.tokenOut).balanceOf(address(this));
```

The resulting tokens are transferred to the user:
```solidity
// libraries/Swap.sol @ function swapTokensMulti
return balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
```

The issue is that there is no check for whether the pool is in a manipulated state. The code simply calculates the amount it will get as output from the **current pool state** and accepts that as minimum. The pool can however already be heavily manipulated.

## Impact
This issue allows for the well-known sandwich attack on user reward payouts:
1. A MEV bot or attacker sees a call to `withdrawRewards` pending in the mempool.
2. He frontruns this transaction with his own, where he dumps `vaultCurrency` tokens into the pool.
3. The user transaction gets executed, which does not check for the pool to be manipulated, and thus further sells the user's `vaultCurrency` tokens into the pool, receiving nearly no tokens in return since the pool is already heavily dumped.
4. The attacker backruns the user's transaction and uses the funds he received from step 2 to buy back `vaultCurrency` from the pool. The profit he makes will be the amount of reward tokens the user earned minus swap fees.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement protection against manipulated pools. There are various ways to solve this issue, the most common ones include:
- use an off-chain oracle such as Chainlink to check whether the current pool price deviates too much from the expected price
- use an on-chain oracle such as Uniswap's TWAP oracle to check whether the current pool price deviates too much from the expected price
- let the user pass a `minAmountOut` parameter to the function, which checks that the final output in tokens is not too low


## Code Snippet
PoC omitted in this case since it should be clearly recognizable that there is no such protection in place and sandwich attacks are a well-known concept.
