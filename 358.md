# First depositor can manipulate share price of MainVault

## Summary
The first depositors can mint 1 share and send in a large amount of Token into MainVault. The price of 1 share will be inflated. The next depositor who deposits will lose out due to a rounding error.
## Vulnerability Detail
The adversary will call `deposit` with the amount of 1 to mint 1 share. He then transfers a large amount of Tokens over 1000 to the address of Mainvault. The price of 1 share is now 1001. The next depositor deposits 2000 and receives 1 share due to a rounding error. The pool has 3001 assets with 2 shares. The adversary can withdraw his 1 share and receive 1500 assets, gaining 500 assets.
```solidity
  function deposit(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 shares) {
    if (training) {
      require(whitelist[msg.sender]);
      uint256 balanceSender = (balanceOf(msg.sender) * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());
      require(_amount + balanceSender <= maxTrainingDeposit);
    }

    uint256 balanceBefore = getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;
    vaultCurrency.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    uint256 balanceAfter = getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds;

    uint256 amount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
    shares = (amount * (10 ** decimals())) / exchangeRate;

    _mint(_receiver, shares);
  }
```

```solidity
  function withdraw(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver,
    address _owner
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    require(value > 0, "!value");

    require(getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds >= value, "!funds");

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    transferFunds(_receiver, value);
  }
```
## Impact
The first depositors can manipulate share prices to gain from future depositors.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend requiring minimum amount of shares for first depositor and burning some shares of first depositor so that price of share will be more resistant.
