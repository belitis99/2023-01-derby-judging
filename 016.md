# Incorrect amount passed

## Summary
Relayer fees is passed incorrectly

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe the `xTransfer` function

```solidity
...
IConnext(connext).xcall{value: (msg.value - _relayerFee)}(
...
```

2. As we can see this is passing `msg.value - _relayerFee` which is incorrect and `_relayerFee` should have been passed

## Impact
Transaction will not succeed as relayer amount passed may be incorrect

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change xcall to below:

```solidity
uint256 relayerFee = _relayerFee != 0 ? _relayerFee : msg.value;
IConnext(connext).xcall{value: relayerFee}(
...
```
