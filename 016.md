# AaveProvider's deposit, withdraw function calls will get reverted when one of the Aave LendingPool is broken or paused

## Summary
AaveProvider's deposit, and withdraw function calls will get reverted when one of the Aave LendingPool is broken or paused.

## Vulnerability Detail
Aave V2 Lending Pool can be paused, which will prevent multiple core functions that the Aave v2 depends on from working, including deposit() and withdraw().

## Impact
When Aave V2 Lending Pool is paused, the deposit, and withdraw function calls on Aave LendingPool will get reverted.
