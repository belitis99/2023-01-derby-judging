# DoS attack vulnerability due to `chainIdOff` mapping in the contract.

## Summary
The `XChainController` contract in the allows a DoS attack, An attacker can use the "chainIdOff" mapping to block deposits and withdrawals on specific `chainIds`, thereby preventing users from depositing or withdrawing their funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    // (chainId => bool): true == off // false == on
    mapping(uint32 => bool) chainIdOff;
```
This mapping allows an attacker to disable all `chainIds` by setting their values to true, thereby preventing users from depositing or withdrawing their funds, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to launch a DoS attack on the contract.

The code uses a mapping named "chainIdOff," a mapping of type `mapping(uint32 => bool)`. It has a boolean value that denotes whether a `chainId` is off or on. If a `chainId` is off, users cannot deposit or withdraw their funds on that `chainId`

The vulnerability can be exploited in the following way:

1. An attacker can call the function to disable all the `chainIds` by setting the `chainIdOff` boolean values to true for all `chainIds`.

2. After disabling all `chainIds`, users will not be able to deposit or withdraw funds on any of the `chainIds`, causing a denial of service.

Below is the code snippet where the vulnerability exists:
```solidity
mapping(uint32 => bool) chainIdOff;
```
## Impact
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by disabling all `chainIds`, thereby preventing users from depositing or withdrawing their funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the `XChainController` contract's code to ensure that the "chainIdOff" mapping cannot be exploited to perform a DoS attack.

The following changes can be made to mitigate this vulnerability:

* Remove the "chainIdOff" mapping from the contract code as it is not being used in the contract code.
* If the "chainIdOff" mapping is required for some functionality, limit the number of `chainIds` that can be turned off, and restrict access to it.
* Implement access control on the "chainIdOff" mapping, only allowing authorized personnel to turn off specific `chainIds`.
* Update the contract's documentation to highlight the risk of DoS attacks through the "chainIdOff" mapping, including possible consequences and recommended best practices to avoid these attacks.

The following code changes can be implemented to remove the "chainIdOff" mapping from the contract code:

```solidity
// Remove the following line:
mapping(uint32 => bool) chainIdOff;

// Change the vaultInfo struct definition to the following:
struct vaultInfo {
    int256 totalCurrentAllocation;
    uint256 totalUnderlying;
    uint256 totalSupply;
    uint256 totalWithdrawalRequests;
    // (chainId => currentAllocation)
    mapping(uint32 => int256) currentAllocationPerChain;
    // (chainId => totalUnderlying)
    mapping(uint32 => uint256) totalUnderlyingPerChain;
    // (chainId => vaultAddress)
    mapping(uint32 => address) vaultChainAddress;
    // (chainId => underlyingAddress): e.g USDC
    mapping(uint32 => address) vaultUnderlyingAddress;
    // (chainId => totalWithdrawalRequests): total withdrawal requests in LP Token
    mapping(uint32 => uint256) withdrawalRequests;
    // (chainId => amountToDeposit)
    mapping(uint32 => uint256) amountToDepositPerChain;
}
```

After making these changes, the updated contract code will be as follows:

```solidity

  struct vaultInfo {
    int256 totalCurrentAllocation;
    uint256 totalUnderlying;
    uint256 totalSupply;

    // (chainId => currentAllocation)
    mapping(uint32 => int256) currentAllocationPerChain;
    // (chainId => totalUnderlying)
    mapping(uint32 => uint256) totalUnderlyingPerChain;
    // (chainId => vaultAddress)
    mapping(uint32 => address) vaultChainAddress;
    // (chainId => underlyingAddress): e.g USDC
    mapping(uint32 => address) vaultUnderlyingAddress;
    // (chainId => totalWithdrawalRequests): total withdrawal requests in LP Token
