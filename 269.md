# vault stakers and game players share the same reward pool

## Summary
Both vault stakers earning yield and game players are taking rewards from the same reward pool. One will take rewards from the other when withdrawing/redeeming.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lets simplify the whole setup a bit to show the issue here. Imagine one vault on one chain with one provider. Alice plays the game and deposits 10 `DRB` all allocated to the provider. Bob deposits 10k `USDC` to the vault.

Time passes the provider has a 10% increase. The funds are now 11k.

Both Bob and Alice are happy with this and want to collect their rewards. Alice redeems her rewards and Bob registers for a withdraw (or just withdraws).

The issue here is that both have claim to the same 1k rewards. Bob who staked should get them as yield for staking and Alice should get them as rewards for playing.

If both manage to withdraw/redeem in the same cycle this is where it will break down:

As the `totalWithdrawalRequests` (Bobs withdraw of all his shares and Alice redeeming of rewards) will be larger than `getTotalUnderlyingVault`.

The issue is not with this line of code though, its with the design of the rewards as game players and vault stakers both have a claim on the same rewards. 

## Impact
If a staker in the vault withdraws they will take rewards from game players and if a game player they will take yield from someone staking. If both at the same time, they will take rewards from user still staking. Resulting in the "last" user possibly not being able to withdraw due to not enough funds.

## Recommendation
Honestly I don't see an easy way out of this:
You could split the pools, but why would anyone stake in the vault then? Since that is just staking with less yield compared to staking in the underlying protocols directly.

You could limit staking to game players, and then make them only split the funds they actually stake. That's a large change to the protocol though and would remove the use for Derby tokens.

You could also limit rewards to only Derby tokens, but that only works as long as there is `DRB` to hand out. It would also require some change to the way the rewards are reserved as currently you can create a reserved rewards greater than underlying thus underflowing in stage 3.
