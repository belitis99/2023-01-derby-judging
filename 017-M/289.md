# Wrong assumption that stablecoins are always equal in price

## Summary

When calculating amounts the protocol wrongly assumes that stable asset prices do not have any discrepancies.

## Vulnerability Detail

When performing a stable coin swap the minimum amount out is calculated as follows:
```solidity
  function swapStableCoins(
    SwapInOut memory _swap,
    uint256 _tokenInUScale,
    uint256 _tokenOutUScale,
    IController.CurveParams memory _curve
  ) public returns (uint256) {
    uint256 amountOutMin = (((_swap.amount * (10000 - _curve.poolFee)) / 10000) * _tokenOutUScale) /
      _tokenInUScale;
```

It assumes that stablecoin prices are equal, e.g. that is 1 USDC = 1 USDT. which is not always the case, especially considering recent events. This can make withdrawals (and deposits) fail or lose value on prices depeg event.

For example, let's say that 1 USDC = 0.9 USDT and `poolFee` is 1%.
A user wants to deposit 100 USDT in USDT Vault to the protocol that accepts USDC. A swap is performed:
`amountOutMin = 100 * (10000 - 100) / 10000 * 10**6 / 10**6 = 99`
While in reality based on the current rate it should receive at least 110 USDC.
On the other hand, if the user wants to deposit USDC, the swap will revert.

## Impact

It is not safe to assume that prices of similar assets are always equal. The current automatic slippage protection is not effective in all cases.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Slippage parameter should be given control to the user (calculated off-chain), or the protocol should use an oracle.
