# Hardcoded WETH

## Summary

The address of `WETH` is hardcoded but it differs on other chains.

## Vulnerability Detail

The swap library has `WETH` hardcoded:
```solidity
address internal constant WETH = 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2;
```
It is used when performing a multi-token swap (tokenA -> WETH -> tokenB).

The scope mentions these deployment environments:
**DEPLOYMENT: Mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain**

This hardcoded `WETH` address does not match other chains. For example, on Arbitrum the address is: https://arbiscan.io/token/0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1

What is more, the next variable (`gasUsedForSwap`) is not used anywhere so I was not sure what is the purpose of it:
```solidity
  uint256 internal constant gasUsedForSwap = 210000;
```

## Impact

The current code of the swap library will only work on mainnet and needs to be manually adjusted before deploying on other chains. If accidentally deployed as it is, then when the time comes to perform the multi-swap, it will throw a runtime error.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Inject the `WETH` address as a parameter.
