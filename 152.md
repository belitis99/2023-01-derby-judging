# Stuck during the cross-chain rebalancing

## Summary
During the cross-chain rebalancing, the vault could need to send (underlying) `amountToSendXChain` to the xChainController,
If `state` is `SendingFundsXChain`. anyone could invoke [rebalanceXChain()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L307-L326) at **anytime**.

## Vulnerability Detail
After, the cross-chain message **XProvider.sol** will:
1- transfer the funds to xChainController 
2- invoke `upFundsReceived()`

```solidity
  function upFundsReceived(
    uint256 _vaultNumber
  ) external onlyXProvider onlyWhenUnderlyingsReceived(_vaultNumber) {
    vaultStage[_vaultNumber].fundsReceived++;
  }
```
As we can see `upFundsReceived()` has a modifier `onlyWhenUnderlyingsReceived()`
```solidity
  // vaultStage 2
  modifier onlyWhenUnderlyingsReceived(uint256 _vaultNumber) {
    require(
      vaultStage[_vaultNumber].underlyingReceived == vaultStage[_vaultNumber].activeVaults,
      "Not all underlyings received"
    );
    _;
  }
```
to check if all the chains of **vaultNumber** send their underlying to xChainController (by invoking `pushTotalUnderlyingToController()` on the main vault)

so in case the xChainController still waiting for the other chains to push their Total Underlying, the modifier `onlyWhenUnderlyingsReceived()` will revert.

As a result of this revert the value ` vaultStage[_vaultNumber].underlyingReceived` won't be updated but the funds are here (in  xChainController)

Also, the **Guardian** doesn't have the ability to update `underlyingReceived` 

## Impact
The protocol will be stuck during the cross-chain rebalancing

## Recommendation
```solidity
  function upUnderlyingReceivedGuard(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint256 x
  ) external onlyGuardian{
    vaultStage[_vaultNumber].underlyingReceived = x;
  }
```
