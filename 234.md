# Incorrect Validation in addToTotalRewards() leads to rewards wrongly getting calculated

## Summary
The code in addToTotalRewards() has an incorrect validation check, were it requires currentRebalancingPeriod to be greater than lastRebalancingPeriod. This will only be true if pushAllocationsToController() is called twice before the user rebalances his basket.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside of the addToTotalRewards() function of the Game contract the currentRebalancingPeriod refers to the vaults rebalancing period.
This value will start at 0 and will increase when pushAllocationsToController() is called. (increased by 1)
lastRebalancingPeriod refers to lastRebalancingPeriod of the basket, which is set to vaults rebalancing period + 1, inside of setBasketRebalancingPeriod().
To enter the rewards calculation inside of addToTotalRewards(), currentRebalancingPeriod has to be greater than lastRebalancingPeriod. This will only be true if the user doesn't call rebalanceBasket() between two pushAllocationsToController() calls.
## Impact
Possible loss of rewards when user calls rebalanceBasket() before second Protocol rebalance.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only allow rebalancing Basket if currentRebalancingPeriod is greater than lastRebalancingPeriod.
Or make it clear for the user that rebalancing the basket will not reward him if he calls the function to early.
