# Malicious users could break the logic of the rebalancing

## Summary
When the [rebalanceNeeded()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L427-L429) is `true` on **MainVault.sol** anyone could invoke `pushTotalUnderlyingToController()`.
Regardless of the state of the vault `vaultOff`

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take this scenario the **MainVault.sol** has only one protocol X and the Game players decide to set the allocations to zero for this protocol X in period N
Now in the period N+1, no Game player set a `deltaAllocationProtocol` to this protocol

so during the cross-chain rebalancing of the period N+1 `XChainController.receiveAllocationsFromGame().receiveAllocationsFromGameInt().settleCurrentAllocation()`
```solidity
  function settleCurrentAllocation(
    uint256 _vaultNumber,
    uint32 _chainId,
    int256 _deltas
  ) internal returns (uint256 activeVault) {
    if (getCurrentAllocation(_vaultNumber, _chainId) == 0 && _deltas == 0) {
      vaults[_vaultNumber].chainIdOff[_chainId] = true;
      activeVault = 0;
    } else {
      vaults[_vaultNumber].chainIdOff[_chainId] = false;
      activeVault = 1;
    }

    vaults[_vaultNumber].totalCurrentAllocation += _deltas;
    vaults[_vaultNumber].currentAllocationPerChain[_chainId] += _deltas;

    require(vaults[_vaultNumber].totalCurrentAllocation >= 0, "Allocation underflow");
  }
```
this statement `if (getCurrentAllocation(_vaultNumber, _chainId) == 0 && _deltas == 0)` will be `true`
Now the `activeVault = 0` means the vault is not counted with the `activeVaults`

`setActiveVaults()` will set the value`activeVaults`
```solidity
  function setActiveVaults(uint256 _vaultNumber, uint256 _activeVaults) internal {
    vaultStage[_vaultNumber].activeVaults = _activeVaults;
  }
```
Now, invoke `pushTotalUnderlyingToController()`, After the cross-chain message `XProvider.sol` will call `xChainController.setTotalUnderlying()` 

This will lead to an increment in the value `underlyingReceived` one more.
```solidity
vaultStage[_vaultNumber].underlyingReceived++;
```
As we know the `activeVaults` won't include this vault.

As a result of this the modifier `onlyWhenUnderlyingsReceived()` will revert when the last active Vault tries to call `setTotalUnderlying()`

## Impact
The **xChainController** will not receive critical values (totalUnderlying, totalSupply, and totalWithdrawalRequests) for an active Vault or more. this will lead to breaking the logic of the rebalancing.

## Recommendation
You need to check the active Vaults
