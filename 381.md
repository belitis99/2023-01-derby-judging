# Users can lose their LP tokens after several withdrawal requests before the first rebalance.



## Summary
`MainVault.withdrawalRequest` can be called several times when `rebalancingPeriod` = 0 so users can lose their LP tokens when they request withdrawal several times.

## Vulnerability Detail

`MainVault.withdrawalRequest` can be called several times when `rebalancingPeriod` = 0. `withdrawalRequest` validates `user.withdrawalRequestPeriod` = 0 first and then sets `user.withdrawalRequestPeriod` = `rebalancingPeriod`.

```solidity
  function withdrawalRequest(
    uint256 _amount
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) { 
    UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
    require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");

    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);

    user.withdrawalAllowance = value;
    user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
    totalWithdrawalRequests += value;
  }
```

So when `rebalancingPeriod` > 0, `withdrawalRequest` can't be called multiple times. But when `rebalancingPeriod` = 0 before the first rebalance, `withdrawalRequest` can be called several times without reversion.

If a user request withdrawal several times by fault, the LP tokens are burned multiple times, but the userâ€™s `withdrawalAllowance` will be only the last one. So the user can lose his LP tokens.

## Impact
The users can lose their LP tokens.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use another flag `withdrawalRequested` in `UserInfo` struct to block multiple withdrawal request.
