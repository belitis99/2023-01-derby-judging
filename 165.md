# Sandwich attack to exchange rate

## Summary
The exchangeRate is calculated and stored during rebalancing which is triggered once per two weeks by a keeper or the DAO.
A malicious user can launch a sandwich attack and profit. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's show how a malicious user, Bob can launch a sandwich attack to exchange rate and profit.

1.Assume currently the exchange rate is 1/1 share and  Bob has 0 shares.

2.Assume a keeper or the DAO try to  trigger the rebalancing, currently the total underlying is larger than the total supply
 as previous redeemed token from external pools of harvestting .
 
3.Bob front-runs ```MainVault.pushTotalUnderlyingToController``` and calls the ```deposit()``` to deposit 100,000 underlying tokens into the mainvault. As a result, Bob has  100,000 shares. The exchange rate is stil 1/1 share.

4.Keeper or the DAO trigger the rebalance , the new exchange rate changes to 12/11
```solidity
    address vault = getVaultAddress(_vaultNumber, _chain);
    require(vault != address(0), "xChainController: not a valid vaultnumber");
    int256 totalAllocation = getCurrentTotalAllocation(_vaultNumber);
    uint256 totalWithdrawalRequests = getTotalWithdrawalRequests(_vaultNumber);
    uint256 totalUnderlying = getTotalUnderlyingVault(_vaultNumber) - totalWithdrawalRequests;
    uint256 totalSupply = getTotalSupply(_vaultNumber);

    uint256 decimals = xProvider.getDecimals(vault);
    uint256 newExchangeRate = (totalUnderlying * (10 ** decimals)) / totalSupply;
```

5.After the rebalance,Bob calls the withdraw() or withdrawalRequest(),he could do that since he had 100,000 underlying tokens in the pool to withdraw 100,000 shares and he will get 100,000*12/11 = 109,090 underlying tokens. Deduct the governanceFee fee. So he has a profit of  underlying tokens by the sandwich attack.
```solidity
  function withdraw(
    uint256 _amount,
    address _receiver,
    address _owner
  ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
    value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

    require(value > 0, "!value");

    require(getVaultBalance() - reservedFunds >= value, "!funds");

    _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    transferFunds(_receiver, value);
  }

```

## Impact
A malicious user can launch a sandwich attack to exchange rate and profit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restrict the maximum deposit amount for each rebalance period

Restrict the maximum withdraw amount for each rebalance period
