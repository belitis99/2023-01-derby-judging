# Inefficient input validation can lead to users locking LP tokens in MainVault.sol

## Summary

In MainVault.withdrawalRequest it is checked whether the user.withdrawalRequestPeriod is 0 in order to prevent them from making 2 withdrawal requests in a single rebalansing period. The problem is that the periods start from 0 which means that this check is useless when rebalancingPeriod = 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

Users are restricted to make only 1 withdrawal request per rebalansing period by the following check in MainVault.withdrawalRequest:

```solidity
require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");
```

This check can be passed (multiple times) when the rebalancingPeriod is 0 (the initial value):

```solidity
user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
```

## Impact

Users can loose funds by locking them in the MainVault. The only way this can happen is if they perform the above actions themselves so I'd consider this a Medium risk instead of a High.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Fix the issue described above in the following way:

```diff
      function withdrawalRequest(
        uint256 _amount
      ) external nonReentrant onlyWhenVaultIsOn returns (uint256 value) {
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
-       require(user.withdrawalRequestPeriod == 0, "Already a request");
+       require(user.withdrawalAllowance == 0, "Already a request");
    
        value = (_amount * exchangeRate) / (10 ** decimals());

+       require(value != 0, "Zero value");

        _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
    
        user.withdrawalAllowance = value;
        user.withdrawalRequestPeriod = rebalancingPeriod;
        totalWithdrawalRequests += value;
      }
```
