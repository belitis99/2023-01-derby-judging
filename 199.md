# Withdrawals served in priority from first vaults may result in misallocation

## Summary
When a Vault has to pull funds from protocol, it will always pull in a greedy way, taking the most it can from the first, moving to second etc..
This means that the first protocol will always be underallocated when withdrawals have to be served. 

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see that:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L111-L128

In pull funds the funds are withdrawn from protocols always in the same order.

On the other hand in executeDeposits:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/Vault.sol#L282-L301

funds are distributed evenly according to allocations.

## Impact
This inconsistent behavior will mean that protocols which come first in the list will always be underallocated for serving withdrawals compared to protocols later in the list.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Withdraw from all protocols evenly to keep the allocations balanced.
