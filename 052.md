# [H-1] Unprotected slippage tolerance can lead to user/protocol loss of funds

## Summary

Slippage is the difference between the expected price of an order and the price when the order actually executes. If the slippage tolerance is set too low, a transaction will not execute. If the slippage tolerance is set too high, users will lose money for paying more per token than intended during XChain swaps. When a rebalance is ready to take place, any user can front run the rebalancXChain() call setting the slippage tolerance to be 100% for the xChain swap.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-derby/blob/main/derby-yield-optimiser/contracts/MainVault.sol#L307-L320

1. Any external user/attacker invokes the `rebalanceXChain()` by frontrunning the transaction when it hits the mempool

2. When the `homechain` is not equal to the `controllerChain` `xTransfer()` is called with the `_slippage` tolerance

3. This XCall will cause the rebalance to be performed, making the proper XChain swaps with the unprotected slippage tolerance.

## Impact

Fulfilled swaps where the actual slippage was higher than what the protocol anticipated would cause significant loss of funds for users since tokens will be swapped for a higher token price than intended.

## Code Snippet

The entrypoint for this attack occurs in the `rebalanceXChain()` function below

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Require minimum and maximum values that the protocol is willing to accept for a slippage tolerance that will not cause significant fund loss during Xchain swaps.
